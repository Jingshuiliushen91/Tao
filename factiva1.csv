1,Extract field,"Lipitor's Safety Again Confirmed in Extensive Analysis of 49 Clinical Trials, Pfizer Says; Important and Timely Information for Physicians Intensively Treating Their Patients' Cholesterol; Patients Taking High Dose (80mg) Lipitor Reported Adverse Events Similar to Patients Taking Low Dose or Placebo",,937 words,17 January 2006,11:58 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 17 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Results of a recent analysis of 49 Lipitor clinical trials involving more than 14,000 patients showed that the overall rates of treatment-related adverse events reported by patients taking the highest dose of Lipitor were low and similar to those reported by patients who received placebo or the lowest dose of Lipitor. The analysis is published in the current edition of the American Journal of Cardiology.","""As more and more evidence has become available on the significant risks of high cholesterol, physicians are now being advised to aggressively lower their patients' cholesterol levels so that they get to their goal,"" said Dr. Gregg Larson, Pfizer vice president of U.S. cardiovascular medical. ""The cost of not getting to goal, both human and financial, can be very high. That's why this information is important and timely: it demonstrates to physicians that they can continue to feel confident in intensively treating their patients' cholesterol even with higher doses of Lipitor, as part of the drive to that all-important goal. As a result, patients get the benefit of even more reduction in their cardiovascular risk -- safely.""

The analysis, which included Lipitor clinical trials that were initiated and completed between 1992 and 2004, tracked the incidence of non-serious and serious muscle, liver and kidney adverse events and laboratory tests. The analysis compared 7,258 patients who received Lipitor 10mg to 4,798 patients taking Lipitor 80mg and 2,180 patients taking placebo. The average age of men and women in the analysis was 59 -- with the oldest patients over 90 years of age. The patients had varying degrees of cardiovascular risk.

  Results include:
  * Lipitor was well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events related
    to the digestive system.
  * There was no direct relationship observed between the dose of Lipitor
    and the frequency of muscle adverse events.
  * The incidence of myalgia (muscle weakness or pain) was low and similar
    in patients taking Lipitor 10mg and 80mg doses.
  * Myopathy (muscle weakness or pain combined with a 10-fold increase in
    muscle enzymes and more severe than myalgia) was rare and unlikely to be
    dose related in Lipitor patients.
  * There were no reported cases of rhabdomyolysis (a rare form of skeletal
    muscle breakdown) in patients taking Lipitor.  In Lipitor-treated
    patients, the overall incidence of elevated liver enzymes was low.
    However, elevated liver enzymes were more frequently observed in
    patients taking 80mg doses of Lipitor compared to patients taking 10mg
    doses of Lipitor.



As in all Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials, adverse events were recorded by the investigators on the basis of symptoms reported by the patient, physical examination findings and abnormal results of any laboratory tests. The adverse events were recorded during the treatment phase and up to 30 days after trial discontinuation.

Since 2004, the Lipitor 80mg dose has also been studied in the Treating to New Targets Trial (TNT) and the Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) clinical trials which have completed and published.

Since the introduction of Lipitor nearly nine years ago, its safety and effectiveness have been supported through an extensive clinical trial program, the Atorvastatin Landmark Program, with more than 400 ongoing and completed trials involving more than 80,000 patients. Lipitor is the most-prescribed cholesterol-lowering therapy in the world with more than 109 million patient years of experience.

""The knowledge that we have gained about cardiovascular disease as a result of this comprehensive clinical trial program has been instrumental in helping us better understand the benefits of the full dose range of Lipitor, which can help both physicians and patients chart the right course for cholesterol treatment."" said Dr. Larson.

About Lipitor

Lipitor(R) (atorvastatin calcium) is a prescription drug. It is used in patients with multiple risk factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol or smoking, to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke and, along with a low-fat diet, to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is used in patients with type 2 diabetes and one other risk factor such as high blood pressure, smoking, or other complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack. Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is not for women who are nursing, pregnant, or may become pregnant

If you take Lipitor, tell your doctor if you feel any unusual muscle pain or weakness. This could be a sign of serious muscle side effects. Tell your doctor about all medicines you take. This may help avoid serious drug interactions. Your doctor should do blood tests to check your liver function before and during drug treatment and may adjust your dose. The most common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. They tend to be mild and often go away.

NEW YORK, Jan. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 financial results today that reflect operating and financial strength, with performance exceeding expectations, driven by in-line medicines, new medicines, and accelerated cost savings, all while promising candidates continue to advance through the company's pipeline.

""We are supporting our key in-line and newly launched medicines, driving important new medicines through the pipeline and taking a series of specific actions to build Pfizer's value,"" said Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer. ""We completed the year with positive news on many fronts -- including double-digit full-year worldwide growth of Lipitor; an exceptional Lyrica launch in the U.S.; priority-review status for two potential breakthrough medicines, Sutent for cancer and Champix for smoking cessation; favorable decisions in Lipitor patent cases; and a 26-percent dividend increase for the first quarter of 2006. Our strategy of driving growth in our in-line medicines and investing in promising new medicines is the essence of the new Pfizer. We will continue to focus on enhancing value for our shareholders and meeting patients' needs worldwide.""

Dr. McKinnell said there were two primary drivers for Pfizer's better- than-expected performance in the quarter: better revenue performance in the Human Health business; and operating expense savings, coupled with the acceleration of the ""Adapting to Scale"" (AtS) cost savings to $800 million in 2005, which is double the goal for the year.

""While we are pleased that Pfizer's performance in 2005 exceeded previous expectations, investors should be aware that the factors driving Pfizer's performance may differ materially in 2006,"" Dr. McKinnell added. ""We look forward to providing a full briefing on our 2006 financial guidance, strategy, products, and pipeline at our analyst meeting in New York on February 10. We enter the new year with renewed determination to capitalize on all the opportunities we see to bring our innovative medicines to those who need them.""

Portfolio, Pipeline Position Human Health for Future Success

""2005 has been a challenging year for Pfizer Human Health,"" said Karen Katen, vice chairman of Pfizer Inc and president of Pfizer Human Health. ""However, fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 results indicate that we are well-positioned for the future, with a solid in-line portfolio and a rich pipeline of innovative new medicines.""

Loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of certain key medicines, uncertainty related to Celebrex, and the suspension of Bextra sales cumulatively reduced 2005 worldwide revenue by $5.7 billion. As a result, total Pfizer Human Health revenue declined $1.8 billion, or 4 percent, for full-year 2005 compared to full-year 2004. In the U.S., Human Health revenue declined 12 percent for the full-year 2005 compared to the same period in 2004.

Excluding the major medicines that lost exclusivity in the U.S. in 2004 and 2005 and the selective COX-2 inhibitors, Human Health adjusted revenues(2) grew 11 percent worldwide and 10 percent in the U.S. for full-year 2005 compared to 2004. The successful launches of seven new medicines over the past two years are enabling Pfizer to replenish our portfolio. The combined sales of these products (Inspra, Caduet, Olmetec, Macugen, Revatio, Zmax, and Lyrica) generated $284 million in fourth-quarter 2005 revenue and $632 million in full-year 2005 revenue worldwide.

Many of Pfizer's top medicines achieved double-digit growth worldwide in 2005 compared to 2004 across many therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular/metabolic diseases (Lipitor up 12 percent, Caduet up 272 percent); central nervous system disorders (Geodon up 26 percent, Relpax up 38 percent); infectious and respiratory diseases (Zyvox up 33 percent, Vfend up 38 percent); oncology (Aromasin up 73 percent); and ophthalmology (Xalatan/Xalacom up 12 percent).

Fourth-Quarter Portfolio Highlights

The cardiovascular portfolio continues to perform well. Cardiovascular sales include another billion-dollar quarter for Norvasc and continued momentum for Caduet, which achieved 323-percent revenue growth worldwide in the fourth quarter to $65 million. Worldwide sales of Lipitor totaled $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth of 3 percent over the previous year's quarter, a difficult comparison in light of Lipitor's 23- percent revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2004, exacerbated by four fewer business days in the 2005 quarter. Full-year sales of $12.2 billion reflected 12-percent growth over 2004.

In the recently published IDEAL study, Lipitor was shown to be numerically superior to Zocor in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. This difference fell just short of statistical significance (p=0.07 vs. significance at p=0.05). Lipitor did achieve statistically significant improvements in major secondary endpoints, including a 13-percent reduction in major cardiovascular events and a 17-percent reduction in non-fatal heart attacks for patients taking Lipitor 80 mg compared to patients taking simvastatin (Zocor) 20 and 40 mg. These results affirm that intensive lipid- lowering with Lipitor 80 mg can safely provide benefits beyond the most commonly prescribed doses of Zocor (20 and 40 mg) in patients with coronary artery disease.

The performance of the central nervous system portfolio was fueled by the launch of Lyrica. Since its September launch, more than 500,000 prescriptions have been written for Lyrica in the U.S. as of December 23, 2005. Lyrica had already gained more than a 7-percent new-prescription share of the U.S. anti- epileptic market as of December 23, continuing its performance as one of Pfizer's most successful pharmaceutical launches. This mirrors the outstanding launch performance seen globally. On a worldwide basis, Geodon exhibited strong full-year growth of 26 percent. This performance far outpaced the rate of market growth. In the U.S., Geodon is the second- fastest-growing atypical anti-psychotic oral medication in new-prescription volume as of November year-to-date. Its balance of powerful efficacy and a favorable metabolic profile positions it for further growth.

In the ophthalmology portfolio, the 9-percent worldwide growth in audited sales of Xalatan/Xalacom outpaced market growth (IMS MIDAS data for the twelve months ending November 2005). These medicines continue to lead the worldwide glaucoma market with a 35.7-percent share of revenues during the same period. Pfizer recently launched the first fully validated glaucoma risk calculator, which will help physicians identify patients with ocular hypertension who are most likely to progress to glaucoma, and determine whether to initiate earlier therapy. Macugen has become an important treatment in the U.S. for wet age- related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in people over 60. While new competitors are expected to enter the market, Macugen has a strong foothold with more than 40,000 patients treated to date. Macugen's favorable safety profile has been maintained for more than two years of clinical testing and marketing.

Despite decreased usage in prescription pain medications, Celebrex continues to be a leader in this field with a 46-percent share of U.S. anti- inflammatory sales and a 22-percent share worldwide for November 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Celebrex was the fastest-growing medicine in the U.S. anti-inflammatory market. Pfizer is currently supporting the Cleveland Clinic's 20,000-patient prospective study to definitively evaluate the relative safety of Celebrex and two older pain medications in patients with heart disease or at high risk of heart disease.

Worldwide full-year 2005 Viagra sales declined 2 percent. Fourth-quarter 2005 sales declined 8 percent, versus the comparable period in 2004, reflecting slower growth in the overall erectile-dysfunction (ED) market and competition from other products. Viagra continues to lead the ED market and is capturing six out of ten new prescriptions for ED in the U.S. through November 2005 year-to-date. Pfizer is supporting consumer ED education with the recent launch of a new unbranded educational campaign in the U.S.

Rich Pipeline of New Medicines Continues to Advance

""We continue to make excellent progress toward our goal of filing 20 major new medicines in the U.S. in the five-year period ending in 2006,"" said Dr. John LaMattina, President of Pfizer Global Research and Development.

In addition to the seven products launched in 2004 and 2005, six additional products are under review by the FDA. Priority review has been granted for three of these -- Sutent (sunitinib), Champix (varenicline), and Eraxis (anidulafungin).

  * Sutent is an oral agent with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity
    that may offer significant advantage to physicians treating patients
    with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and Gleevec-resistant
    gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

  * Champix, a novel partial nicotinic agonist for smoking cessation, has
    been shown to be more effective than the only other oral anti-smoking
    prescription medicine.

  * In a recent study, the antifungal agent Eraxis has shown significant
    benefit over fluconazole in the treatment of candidemia and invasive
    candidiasis and has received an approvable letter from the FDA for
    esophageal candidiasis.

  Three other products are currently under review by the FDA:

  * Exubera, the inhaled insulin drug for type 1 and type 2 diabetes,
    represents the first non-injectable form of insulin available for
    diabetics.  It has been recommended for approval by the FDA advisory
    committee and for marketing authorization by the Committee for Medicinal
    Products in Europe.  Pfizer has reached an agreement to acquire sanofi-
    aventis's share of worldwide rights to Exubera, as well as the insulin
    production facilities located in Frankfurt previously jointly owned by
    the two companies.

  * Indiplon is filed for two NDAs for the treatment of adult insomnia, in
    immediate-release and modified-release formulations.

  * We have received an approvable letter from the FDA for Zeven
    (dalbavancin), a once-weekly intravenous antibiotic for the treatment
    of complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by Gram-
    positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
    aureus.  This is Pfizer's second major product filing resulting from the
    recent acquisition of Vicuron.



""And we reached several important milestones during the fourth quarter in our ongoing efforts to bring new innovative therapies to patients around the world,"" said Dr. LaMattina.

Ticilimumab (CP-675,206), an anti-CTLA4 receptor antagonist, began Phase 3 testing in December. The compound is a monoclonal antibody and another addition in Pfizer's growing pipeline of large-molecule biologics. Ticilimumab may offer an important new option for treating metastatic melanoma, which has a five-year survival rate of less than 10 percent.

In 2005, Pfizer extended our long history of successful alliances and acquisitions with a series of agreements with Angiosyn, BioRen, Coley, Idun, Incyte, Renovis, Rigel, and Vicuron, several of which are already demonstrating strong results. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Pfizer began two Phase 3 trials for non-small-cell lung cancer using a novel anti-cancer agent PF-3512676 (formerly CpG 7909), licensed from Coley Pharmaceutical Group. Based on Phase 2 survival data, this compound may offer a significant advancement over current therapies in treating non-small-cell lung cancer.

Pfizer also entered a global collaborative research and licensing agreement with Incyte Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2005, giving us exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to a portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds for the potential treatment of inflammation. The most advanced compound is currently in Phase 2a studies in rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-resistant obese patients.

Leveraging Financial Strength

""Pfizer is undertaking a series of actions to employ the company's strong positive cash flow for the short- and long-term benefit of shareholders,"" said David Shedlarz, vice chairman. ""Given the strength of our operations, in December 2005 we increased our dividend for the first quarter of 2006 by 26 percent to 24 cents per share, while continuing to invest for long-term growth. With this increase, Pfizer will have increased dividends every year for 39 consecutive years. In 2005, we repatriated nearly $37 billion in foreign earnings, which Pfizer is using to enhance its balance sheet and invest in business opportunities. In addition, the company purchased nearly $4 billion in common stock in 2005, and it will continue to buy back its stock in 2006. Pfizer's sterling triple-A credit rating was also reaffirmed by Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

""With these and other actions, we are demonstrating to shareholders our commitment to work to enhance the value of their investment in Pfizer,"" Mr. Shedlarz concluded.

""Pfizer's earnings performance in the fourth quarter reflected operational flexibility, exceeding the estimate we announced in October 2005 for a number of reasons,"" said Alan Levin, senior vice president and chief financial officer. ""Human Health revenues were stronger than previously forecast, reflecting an unexpected two-week delay in the introduction of azithromycin (Zithromax) generics in the U.S., strong early market acceptance of Lyrica, and better-than-anticipated performance in certain key markets (Japan and Germany) and in certain key products (Zyrtec and Norvasc). The fourth quarter of 2005 had four fewer business days than the fourth quarter of 2004; this is reflected in more tempered revenues and operating expenditures for the quarter. Full-year 2005 figures reflect a comparable number of days to 2004.

""Cost of sales for the quarter remained under pressure, although the impact of changes in the geographic, product, and segment mix of our products was partially mitigated by the favorable impact of foreign exchange during the quarter. The modest rate of growth in Selling, Informational and administrative expenses and the decline in Research and Development expenditures is due in part to greater savings associated with our Adapting to Scale (AtS) initiative. For the full year, AtS savings of approximately $800 million were realized, double our original goal for the year. We also achieved approximately $4.2 billion in synergies through 2005 in connection with our acquisition and integration of Pharmacia Corporation.

""Relative to prior expectations, fourth-quarter and full-year reported net income and diluted EPS reflect our enhanced operating performance during the quarter, partially offset by higher AtS implementation costs,"" Mr. Levin concluded.

       Pfizer Continues Aggressive Defense of Intellectual Property
                With Important Lipitor, Norvasc Victories



In December 2005, Pfizer prevailed in a U.S. court decision involving a patent challenge to Lipitor, the world's most popular cholesterol-lowering medicine. The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware determined that two U.S. patents covering atorvastatin, the active ingredient in Lipitor, are valid and infringed by the product of generic manufacturer Ranbaxy Labs LTD (Ranbaxy), thus protecting Lipitor's exclusivity until June 2011.

The U.S. decision marked one more major victory over Ranbaxy, which is using legal challenges in an attempt to overturn Pfizer's atorvastatin patents in the U.S. and many other markets. In October 2005, the United Kingdom's High Court upheld the exclusivity of the basic patent covering atorvastatin. The ruling prohibits Ranbaxy from introducing a generic version of atorvastatin in the U.K. until the patent expires in November 2011. Both the U.S. and U.K. decisions have been appealed.

""Lipitor represents nothing less than one of the most important medical breakthroughs from pharmaceutical research, and the courts are sending a clear message that the legal system should support and encourage this kind of innovation,"" said Jeffrey Kindler, vice chairman and general counsel. ""We continue to believe that policymakers should examine a system in which generic companies can take as many 'shots on goal' as they wish, employing lawyers, not medical researchers, around the world to undermine confidence in research- based companies and the jobs they support. Our only course is to aggressively defend our patents and stand for principles we believe in, on behalf of the patients we serve and the future of medical innovation.""

In a separate case, Pfizer announced yesterday that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois upheld Pfizer's U.S. patent covering amlodipine besylate, the active ingredient in Norvasc, which had been challenged by the generic manufacturer Apotex.

               Disaster Relief Efforts, Access Initiatives
                     Highlight Corporate Citizenship



Pfizer continues to make progress in its initiatives to expand access to medicines and healthcare resources and to demonstrate excellence in corporate citizenship.

During 2005, the company made substantial contributions to the relief and recovery efforts in response to an unprecedented series of natural disasters, including the Asian tsunami, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the U.S. Gulf States, and the earthquake that struck Pakistan and India. In partnership with relief organizations and local authorities in the affected regions, Pfizer and its colleagues donated funds, medicines, and healthcare supplies and supported the rebuilding of critical healthcare infrastructure.

The company also advanced healthcare programs and partnerships in the developing world during 2005, including a program to train medical professionals across Africa in diagnosis and management of patients with HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis; a multi-country initiative to eliminate trachoma, the world's leading cause of preventable blindness; and a program in 42 developing countries to train healthcare providers in the treatment of opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS.

Pfizer Changing to Meet Changing Times

""While 2005 was one of the most difficult years in memory, it ended well,"" Dr. McKinnell concluded. ""2005 will be seen as a pivotal year in Pfizer's history -- the last year of the old Pfizer. We are once again doing what every generation of Pfizer colleagues has had to do since the late 1800s -- change our company to meet changing times.""

For additional details, please see the attached financial schedules, product revenue tables, supplemental financial information, and Disclosure Notice.

  (1) ""Adjusted income"" and ""adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)""
       are defined as reported net income and reported diluted EPS,
       excluding discontinued operations, cumulative effect of a change in
       accounting principles, purchase accounting adjustments, merger-
       related costs, and certain significant items.  As described under

       Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's
       Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended October 2, 2005, management
       uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals
       and to measure the performance of the overall company.  We believe
       that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by
       disclosing this measure.  A reconciliation to reported net income and
       reported diluted EPS is provided in the table accompanying this
       report.  The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are
       not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net
       income and diluted EPS.

  (2) Human Health adjusted revenues are defined as total Human Health
      revenues excluding the revenues of selective COX-2 inhibitors and
      major products that have lost exclusivity in the U.S. since the

  (1) The above financial statement presents the three-month and twelve-
      month periods ended December 31 of each year. Subsidiaries operating
      outside the United States are included for the three-month and twelve-
      month periods ended November 30 of each year.

  (2) As required, the estimated value of Merger-related in-process research
      and development charges (IPR&D) is expensed at acquisition date.  In
      2005, we expensed $1.7 billion of IPR&D, of which $1.4 billion related
      to our acquisition of Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the third
      quarter and $250 million related to our acquisition of Idun
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the second quarter.  In 2004, we expensed
      $1.1 billion of IPR&D, of which $920 million related to our
      acquisition of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. in the first quarter.

  (3) Other (income)/deductions -- net in the fourth quarter of 2004
      includes a charge of $691 million in connection with an intangible
      asset impairment related to Depo-Provera. Other (income)/deductions --
      net in 2005 includes an impairment charge of $1.2 billion related to
      the developed technology rights and the write-off of machinery and
      equipment for Bextra, a selective COX-2 inhibitor.  Other
      (income)/deductions -- net in 2004 includes a charge of $691 million
      in connection with an intangible asset impairment related to
      Depo-Provera and $369 million in connection with certain litigation-
      related charges.

  (4) Provision for taxes on income in 2005 includes tax benefits associated
      with the resolution of certain tax positions ($586 million) and taxes
      on the repatriation of foreign earnings ($1.7 billion).

  (5) In December 2005, we adopted the provisions of the Financial
      Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting
      for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), a new
      accounting interpretation issued in March 2005.  As a result, we
      recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $40 million ($25 million, net of
      tax) for costs associated with the eventual retirement of certain
      facilities. This charge is reported as a one-time cumulative effect of
      a change in accounting principle in the fourth quarter of 2005.

  (1) Human Health adjusted revenues, which excludes the revenues of
      selective COX-2 inhibitors and major products which have lost
      exclusivity in the U.S. since the beginning of 2004, is an alternative
      view of our Human Health revenue performance and we believe that
      investors' understanding of Human Health revenue growth is enhanced by
      disclosing this performance measure.  Zithromax, Neurontin, Diflucan
      and Accupril/Accuretic recently lost their U.S. exclusivity and, as is
      typical in the pharmaceutical industry, this has resulted in a
      dramatic decline in revenues due to generic competition.  Celebrex and
      Bextra, as a result of a recent regulatory evaluation of the risks and
      benefits of all COX-2 medicines, have also experienced a significant
      decline in sales.  Specifically, the regulatory review of and
      conclusions regarding Celebrex have resulted in a reduction in sales
      this year as physicians evaluate the evolving information on the risks
      and benefits of all NSAIDs and revised labeling, and on April 7, 2005,
      the FDA requested the suspension of Bextra sales and marketing based
      on its assessment of an unfavorable risk/benefit profile due to the
      additional increased risk of rare, serious skin reactions compared to
      other NSAIDs. We believe that excluding the impact of these products
      assists the reader in understanding the underlying strength of the
      balance of our diverse Human Health product portfolio in 2005.
      Because of its non-standardized definition, this adjusted Human Health
      revenues measure has limitations as it may not be comparable with the
      calculation of similar measures of other companies.  This additional
      revenue measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for
      the U.S. GAAP comparison of Human Health revenue growth.

                                PFIZER INC
                    SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

  1)  Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues



Changes in foreign-exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2005 relative to the same period in the prior year had a nominally favorable impact on revenue growth of $36 million, or 0.2%. The weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the euro, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, and British pound, for the twelve months of 2005 compared to the twelve months of 2004 favorably impacted full-year 2005 revenues by $945 million, or 1.8%.

2) Impact of Accounting Calendar on Revenues

Pfizer's accounting calendar had three additional business days in the first quarter relative to 2004. Pfizer's second and third fiscal quarters of 2005 had the same number of business days as the prior year. The fourth quarter, however, had four fewer business days than the prior year (six fewer calendar days).

3) Change in Cost of Sales

Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 17.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 15.8% in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in the cost of sales margin principally reflects unfavorable geographic, segment, and product mix; adverse changes in production volume; and AtS costs ($87 million); partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange.

Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 16.6% for the twelve months of 2005 from 14.4% for the twelve months of 2004. The increase reflects unfavorable geographic, segment, and product mix; adverse changes in production volume; AtS costs ($124 million); and costs associated with Bextra ($73 million), among other factors.

4) Costs Relating to Adapting to Scale Productivity Initiative

Costs relating to the Adapting to Scale (AtS) initiative were $470 million and $780 million, pre-tax, for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2005. We expect the costs associated with this multi-year effort to continue through 2008 and to total $4 billion to $5 billion, on a pre-tax basis. The actions associated with the AtS initiative will include restructuring charges -- such as asset impairments, exit costs, and severance and severance-related costs -- and associated implementation costs, such as accelerated depreciation charges, primarily associated with plant network optimization efforts, and expenses associated with system and process standardization and the expansion of shared services.

5) Merger-Related Costs

Pharmacia merger-related costs totaled $928 million for 2005. Cumulative costs from 2002 through 2005 were $5.4 billion, consistent with expectations at the time of the acquisition. Merger-related synergies through 2005 totaled approximately $4.2 billion. Pharmacia merger-related initiatives are essentially complete, and we will not incur material Pharmacia merger-related costs going forward.

  * Certain 2004 amounts were reclassified to conform to the 2005
    presentation.



In connection with the decision to suspend sales of Bextra in the first quarter of 2005, we recorded a charge of $1.1 billion relating to the impairment of Bextra's intangible assets for developed technology rights and the write-off of machinery and equipment of $5 million.

In the third quarter of 2004, Pfizer recorded a litigation-related charge of $369 million related to the resolution of claims against Quigley Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a non-cash charge of $691 million upon determining that an indefinite-lived intangible asset relating to Depo-Provera had become impaired.

7) Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate used in calculating reported income for 2005 is 29.7%. The effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted income(1) is 22.2%. The difference between the adjusted tax rate and the reported tax rate primarily reflects the tax impact on foreign earnings repatriated pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act, resolution of certain tax positions, as well as the tax impacts of purchase accounting and the Bextra impairment.

8) Share-Purchase Program

We believe that purchase of our stock is an excellent investment opportunity. Since the beginning of 1999, Pfizer has purchased more than $35.6 billion of its common stock. In the second quarter of 2005, the company completed the $5 billion share-purchase program authorized in October 2004. On June 23, 2005, Pfizer announced the authorization of a new $5 billion share-purchase program. By the end of 2005, Pfizer had purchased approximately 22 million shares valued at approximately $493 million under the new program. In total, the company purchased nearly 144 million shares of common stock, valued at $3.8 billion, during 2005. We remain committed to completing our new $5 billion share-purchase program.

All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that the European Commission has approved Exubera (inhaled human insulin) for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Exubera is the first non-injectable, inhalable form of insulin to be approved since the discovery of insulin in the 1920s, and represents a major advance in diabetes treatment.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes has reached epidemic proportions and affects approximately 48 million people in Europe alone. People with diabetes often suffer from debilitating complications due to uncontrolled blood sugar levels including heart disease, amputation, blindness and kidney failure. The direct healthcare costs associated with diabetes are estimated to be around $286 billion worldwide, with the majority of these costs linked to treating diabetes-related complications.","Since its discovery more than 80 years ago, insulin has been the gold standard treatment for diabetes. In order to achieve tight blood sugar control, insulin is often administered before meals to mimic the body's natural insulin response to food. Healthcare providers and patients have been reluctant to initiate or intensify insulin therapy when it is required due to the need for daily injections.

""Exubera is a major, first-of-its-kind, medical breakthrough that marks another critical step forward in the treatment of diabetes, a disease that has taken an enormous human and economic toll worldwide,"" said Hank McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ""The global incidence of diabetes is currently at epidemic levels. Millions of patients are not achieving or maintaining acceptable blood sugar levels, despite the availability of current therapies. Exubera meets a critical medical need by offering a highly effective and needle-free alternative to diabetes pills and insulin injections to manage this complicated, debilitating disease.""

Exubera is a fast-acting, dry powder formulation of human insulin that is inhaled into the lungs via the mouth before meals using a simple-to-use, hand-held device that does not require batteries or electricity. The device, which weighs four ounces and is about the size of a carrying case for a pair of eye glasses, is designed to deliver an accurate and precise dose of insulin each time it is used.

Exubera is the result of one of the most rigorous and innovative diabetes development programs ever and Pfizer's investment now stands at over $1 billion. Pfizer invested in two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities -- the world's largest insulin plant in Frankfurt, Germany, and a high-tech facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, U.S. -- well ahead of regulatory actions, so that the product can reach patients as quickly as possible.

The efficacy and safety profile of Exubera was studied in more than 2,500 adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes for an average duration of 20 months. In studies in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, Exubera was shown to be as effective as injectable insulin in achieving glycemic control. In adults with type 2 diabetes who are not sufficiently controlled with commonly used oral therapies, Exubera has been shown to provide greater improvements in glycemic control. In addition, patients who took Exubera reported greater overall treatment satisfaction and acceptance compared to insulin injections or oral therapies.

""This is really good news for physicians and patients. It is truly a clinical and scientific milestone -- being able to give insulin without needles,"" said Chantal Mathieu, Professor of Endocrinology, University of Leuven, Belgium. ""Physicians face many challenges with insulin therapy due to patients' reluctance to take injections, which up until now, was the only way to take insulin. With Exubera, patients now have another opportunity to take control of their blood sugar and take an active role in managing this complicated disease.""

About Exubera

To further support the effective use of Exubera, Pfizer is investing in extensive educational programs to support healthcare professionals and patients.

Exubera is a product of a collaboration between Pfizer Inc and Nektar Therapeutics. Pfizer recently reached an agreement to acquire the sanofi-aventis worldwide rights to Exubera. The two companies were previously in a worldwide alliance to co-develop, co-promote and co-manufacture Exubera.

In the European Union, Exubera has been approved for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes (greater than 18 years of age) not adequately controlled with oral antidiabetic agents and requiring insulin therapy. Exubera is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in addition to long or intermediate acting injectable insulin, for whom the potential benefits of adding inhaled insulin outweigh the potential safety concerns.

Exubera is pending approval in the U.S. In September 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee recommended that Exubera should be approved for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

There are two major forms of diabetes -- type 1 and type 2. In type 1, which typically develops in childhood, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas have been destroyed leading to a complete lack of insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the most common and progressive form of the disease, the body does not effectively use nor produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, and eventually most people with type 2 diabetes will need insulin to achieve blood sugar control.

Important Safety Information about Exubera

The safety profile and tolerability of Exubera have been extensively studied in clinical trials. Adverse events throughout the clinical development program were generally mild to moderate, and discontinuation rates were low.

Patients should not take Exubera if they have poorly controlled or unstable lung disease, or if they smoke or have stopped smoking less than six months prior to starting Exubera treatment. If a patient starts smoking or resumes smoking, he or she must stop using Exubera and see a health care provider about a different treatment.

Before starting treatment with Exubera, a health care provider will carry out a simple test to check lung function. The test involves exhaling into a measuring device. This will help to find out if Exubera is the right treatment for individual patients. Once a patient starts treatment, it is recommended that a health care provider should check lung function again at six months (see full prescribing information).

A small decrease in lung function may occur during Exubera treatment although symptoms might not be noticeable. This change occurs within the first months of treatment and should not worsen as treatment is continued.

Like all medicines, Exubera can cause side effects. As with all forms of insulin, a possible side effect of Exubera is low blood sugar levels.

Some patients have reported a mild cough while taking Exubera, which occurred within seconds to minutes after Exubera inhalation. Coughing occurred less frequently as patients continued to use Exubera.

Consecutive inhalation of three 1mg unit dose blisters causes a significantly higher insulin exposure than inhalation of one 3mg unit dose blister. Therefore, three 1mg unit dose blisters should not be substituted for one 3mg unit dose blister.

19,Extract field,"Pfizer's Lyrica Receives Positive Opinion From CHMP for the Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Adults; Under-Recognized, Poorly-Treated and Stigmatized Condition Frequently Associated with High Levels of Patient Distress and Impairment; UK Expert: Psychological and Physical Effects of GAD Disrupt Work and Personal Relationships and Make it Difficult to Carry on with Everyday Activities",,544 words,27 January 2006,11:24 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization of Lyrica(R) (pregabalin), a novel mechanism for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults.

The CHMP's positive recommendation will be reviewed by the European Commission, which has authority to approve medicines for the European Union. Pfizer anticipates a final decision from the Commission in the coming months.","""Though GAD has been formally recognized by the medical community and is frequently associated with high levels of distress and impairment, the condition often goes undetected and untreated,"" said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer. ""It is estimated that only one-third of those who suffer from this condition seek treatment despite the significant impact on patient quality of life. We are pleased that the CHMP has recognized the potential therapeutic benefits of Lyrica in treating this serious medical condition.""

GAD, which affects an estimated five percent of people at some point in their lives, is a psychiatric disorder characterized by excessive worry as well as physical symptoms such as poor sleep, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability and restlessness. GAD affects slightly more women than men, and symptoms are often chronic and worsen during times of stress. GAD occurs more frequently in patients with chronic medical illnesses, particularly in connection with pain syndromes. The direct annual healthcare costs associated with GAD in Europe are approximately $1.5 billion.

""Despite frequent visits to their doctor, GAD patients are still very poorly treated."" said Dr. Stuart Montgomery, Professor of Psychiatry, Imperial College School of Medicine, University of London. ""The psychological and physical effects of GAD disrupt work and personal relationships and make it difficult to carry on with everyday activities. Accurate diagnosis of GAD is important since prolonged anxiety increases impairment and worsens the outcome of co-existing physical illnesses.""

Lyrica has been approved for various neuropathic pain indications including peripheral neuropathic pain, diabetic and postherpetic neuropathic pain and adjunctive therapy for epilepsy in more than 50 countries outside of the United States. The most common adverse events in Lyrica's clinical development program were dizziness and somnolence. In the U.S., Lyrica(R) (pregabalin) capsules C-V is FDA approved for the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures. Developed by Pfizer, Lyrica is an alpha-2-delta ligand that is believed to work by calming hyper-excited neurons.

All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that Exubera(R) (insulin human [rDNA origin]) Inhalation Powder has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Exubera was found in clinical trials to be as effective as short-acting insulin injections, and to significantly improve blood sugar control when added to diabetes pills. Exubera, which is expected to be available for patients by mid-year, is the first inhaled form of insulin and the first insulin option that does not need to be administered by injection in the United States.","""Exubera is a major, first-of-its-kind, medical breakthrough that marks another critical step forward in the treatment of diabetes, a disease that has taken an enormous human and economic toll worldwide,"" said Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. ""The global incidence of diabetes is currently at epidemic levels. Millions of patients are not achieving or maintaining acceptable blood sugar levels, despite the availability of current therapies. Exubera meets a critical medical need by offering a highly effective and needle-free alternative to diabetes pills and insulin injections to manage this complicated, debilitating disease.""

Exubera is a rapid-acting, dry powder human insulin that is inhaled through the mouth into the lungs prior to eating, using the handheld Exubera Inhaler. The Exubera inhaler weighs four ounces and, when closed, is about the size of an eyeglass case. The unique Exubera Inhaler produces in its chamber a cloud of insulin powder, which is designed to pass rapidly into the bloodstream to regulate the body's blood sugar levels.

Exubera Meets Medical Need

""Many people who could benefit from insulin are fearful of injections, so they delay treatment five years or ten years, placing them at risk for serious complications. Now, for the first time patients can improve blood sugar control with fewer or no painful injections,"" said Dr. William Cefalu, Exubera investigator and chief of the division of nutrition and chronic diseases at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, a campus of the Louisiana State University System, in Baton Rouge.

The efficacy and safety profile of Exubera was studied in more than 2,500 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes for an average duration of 20 months. In clinical trials, many patients using Exubera reported greater treatment satisfaction than patients taking insulin by injection. Significantly more patients who had used both Exubera and insulin injections or diabetes pills reported an overall preference for Exubera.

""With Exubera, I've been able to control my blood sugar levels and not constantly worry about how I manage my diabetes,"" said Jamie Villastrigo, a type 2 diabetes patient and Exubera clinical trial participant.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, Exubera can be used alone as an alternative to rapid-acting insulin injections or diabetes pills, or in combination with diabetes pills or longer-acting insulin. In patients with type 1 diabetes, Exubera will be used in combination with longer-acting insulin.

The Burden of Diabetes in the United States

Complications commonly associated with uncontrolled or poorly controlled blood sugar levels include heart disease, amputation, blindness and kidney failure. Diabetes and its complications are estimated to account for $132 billion in direct and indirect health care costs annually.

Nearly 21 million Americans have diabetes and approximately 95 percent of these people have type 2 diabetes.

In type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well enough to manage blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes progresses over time, and eventually most patients will need to administer insulin to achieve blood sugar control. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin at all. These patients must take insulin to survive.

All people with type 1 diabetes and a large percentage of people with type 2 diabetes need treatment with insulin. While insulin has been proven to be effective to reduce blood sugar levels and the risk of complications, health care providers and patients often have been unwilling to start treatment. Factors include patients' fear of injections and social embarrassment associated with needles.

Exubera is the result of one of the most rigorous and innovative diabetes development programs. Pfizer has invested in two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities -- the world's largest insulin plants in Frankfurt, Germany, and a highly automated, high-tech production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.

Exubera is a product of a collaboration between Pfizer and Nektar Therapeutics. Pfizer recently reached an agreement to acquire the sanofi- aventis worldwide rights to Exubera. The two companies were previously in a worldwide alliance to co-develop, co-promote and co-manufacture Exubera.

Important Safety Information about Exubera

Patients should not take Exubera if they smoke or have stopped smoking less than six months prior to starting Exubera treatment. If a patient starts smoking or resumes smoking, he or she must stop using Exubera and see a health care provider about a different treatment.

Exubera may affect lung function so patients need to have their lungs tested before starting Exubera, and periodically thereafter, as directed by a healthcare provider. The test involves exhaling into a measuring device. Exubera is not recommended for people that have chronic lung disease (such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema). Also, Exubera should not be used at all by people with unstable or poorly controlled lung disease.

Like all medicines, Exubera can cause side effects. As with all forms of insulin, a possible side effect of Exubera is low blood sugar levels. Some patients have reported a mild cough while taking Exubera, which occurred within seconds to minutes after Exubera inhalation. Coughing occurred less frequently as patients continued to use Exubera.

Patients and health care providers can call 1-800-EXUBERA and register to receive more information about Exubera when it is available. The hotline can be accessed in English.

28,Extract field,"European Commission Approves Macugen for Treatment of All Types of Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration; First Treatment to Target Underlying Disease Process of Wet AMD; ""Each year there are an estimated 500,000 new cases of Wet AMD worldwide, so new treatment options are crucially important""",,810 words,2 February 2006,12:14 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Feb. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization for Macugen(R) (pegaptanib sodium injection) for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age- related macular degeneration (AMD), an age-related eye disease that destroys central vision critical to reading, driving and color vision.

Macugen is the first treatment to target the underlying disease process and has been proven to help preserve visual acuity in patients with wet AMD. Clinical studies showed that Macugen prevented severe vision loss at twice the rate of standard care, which included photodynamic therapy.","""Macugen represents an important treatment advance for this leading cause of irreversible vision loss,"" said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer. ""Macugen is the first therapy indicated in Europe for the treatment of all types of wet AMD, regardless of lesion subtype, size or visual acuity. Pfizer is committed to bringing innovative medicines to patients facing the loss of vision caused by wet AMD, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and other diseases of the eye.""

Wet AMD is a chronic, progressive disease of the macula, the central portion of the retina responsible for sight that allows people to see faces, walk stairs and engage in daily activities. Central vision is impaired when abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the macula, known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), causes bleeding and other fluid accumulation in the retina.

""While the problem of wet AMD is a global one, it hits particularly hard in areas with rapidly aging populations, such as Europe,"" said Steve Winyard, chairman of the AMD Alliance International. ""Each year there are an estimated 500,000 new cases of wet AMD worldwide, so new treatment options are crucially important.""

About Macugen

Macugen is indicated for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.

Macugen is the first of a new type of ophthalmic drug that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF 165), a protein that acts as a signal in triggering CNV, the single disease process underlying all subtypes of wet AMD. By selectively binding to VEGF 165, Macugen reduces blood vessel growth and leakage, thereby limiting the progression of vision loss and helping patients preserve the vision they have.

The approval was based on the results of two pivotal clinical trials involving 1,186 patients with all subtypes of wet AMD. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients protected from a three-line loss of visual acuity on the eye chart by week 54. Seventy percent of patients who had 0.3 mg of Macugen every six weeks lost fewer than three lines of vision on the eye chart, compared with 55 percent of patients in the control group -- a 27 percent treatment benefit. After one year, patients were randomized to continue or discontinue treatment for another year. Two-year clinical data from the studies demonstrated a continued treatment benefit with Macugen and that treatment should be initiated as early as possible.

Overall, Macugen was well tolerated. Patients on Macugen for two years received over 90 percent of possible injections, indicating strong compliance and acceptance to therapy. Most of the adverse events reported over the two years were mild in severity, transient and attributed by investigators to the injection procedure rather than the study drug.

Macugen is contraindicated in patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infection or with known hypersensitivity to the active or inactive substances.

Rare post-marketing cases of an allergic reaction have been reported in patients within several hours after injection with Macugen, although a direct relationship to Macugen or other factors has not been established.

The safety and efficacy of Macugen beyond two years have not been demonstrated.

Macugen has been approved by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Pakistan and the Philippines, with filings submitted in 15 other countries. More than 50,000 patients with wet AMD have been treated with Macugen in the United States last year. Macugen is an important addition to a Pfizer ophthalmology portfolio that includes market-leading glaucoma medications Xalatan/Xalacom.

Pfizer has an exclusive license from OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to develop and market Macugen outside of the United States. Pfizer and OSI jointly develop and market Macugen in the United States.

37,Extract field,"New Peer-To-Peer, Diabetes Self-Management Program to Address Health Disparities in Underserved Populations; Pfizer Health Solutions and Community HealthCare Center, an Alliance of Volunteers in Medicine, Collaborate to Offer a Culturally Relevant Health Education Program to People with Diabetes",,910 words,7 February 2006,12:16 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"SAVANNAH, Ga., Feb. 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Pfizer Health Solutions Inc (PHS) and Community Healthcare Center (CHC) have officially launched a culturally appropriate diabetes education program to help reduce health disparities for people with diabetes among Savannah's Hispanic and African American communities. The Amigos En Salud(TM) (""Friends in Health"") program is based on a community health worker (CHW) model which educates, empowers and motivates people with diabetes to help them better manage their disease, which in turn leads to improved health and lower health care costs in local communities.","CHC is a member of the Volunteers in Medicine (VIM) Alliance of Free Clinics that provides free primary health care to the medically uninsured and underinsured. In Georgia, where VIM has helped establish four other clinics in Brunswick, Jasper, Macon and Warner Robins, 15 percent of those with a household income of less than $15,000 have diabetes, more than twice the state average of 6.8 percent.(i) Local CHWs have been trained to offer group and individual health education to people with diabetes and their family members so they can learn new techniques to better manage their health. Diabetes is often accompanied by other serious health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and depression, and requires individuals to make changes in their lifestyle, such as eating healthy, being more physically active, and consistently monitoring their blood sugar.

""The Amigos en Salud program will give Savannah's underserved population with diabetes the education and tools to help them take control of their own health,"" said Julia Portale, director of community health, PHS. ""Amigos en Salud provides access to local community health workers and resources that complement each person's culture and individual lifestyles.""

Amigos en Salud is now available to eligible individuals with diabetes in Chatham County. The program is designed to help participants achieve clinical and behavioral health outcomes that mirror the American Diabetes Association standards of care, including glycemic control and lifestyle modification related to healthy eating and regular physical activity.

""The trained community health workers will support CHC health care professionals by providing follow-up and social support to patients, helping them overcome cultural, language or behavioral barriers to treatment,"" said Miriam Rittmeyer, M.D., Executive Director of CHC. ""We believe this community- based approach will improve the health of the people we serve in Savannah and is a promising approach to improve care and reduce health care costs by helping prevent serious complications of diabetes.""

About Amigos en Salud

Amigos en Salud, which translates to ""Friends in Health,"" is a culturally appropriate diabetes self-management program that addresses cultural perceptions and lifestyles. The Amigos en Salud program is designed to help patients with diabetes understand their condition, encourage and sustain behavior change, support development of self-management skills, and provide ongoing community support -- in the context of individual cultures.

The program uses trained community health workers, working collaboratively with health care practitioners, to provide individual and group health education sessions to support patients with diabetes. The CHWs also work directly with patients and family members to develop and implement culturally relevant behavior change strategies, using bilingual education materials at the appropriate literacy level, as necessary.

Since 2002, the Amigos program, developed by Pfizer Health Solutions, has been implemented in multiple communities throughout the United States: Laredo and Brownsville, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Hartford, Connecticut; and Jersey City, New Jersey. In these pilot programs, the patients who participated showed improvement in the American Diabetes Association's goal of lowered HbA1c and LDL cholesterol and exhibited improved adherence to diabetes process measures, including nutrition counseling, eye exams, foot exams, physician visits, and obtaining HbA1c tests. Behavioral changes, like eating healthy and exercising, also significantly improved.

About Community HealthCare Center / Volunteers in Medicine

Community HealthCare Center provides access to primary health care in a dignified and compassionate way to people between the ages of 18 and 64 years who live or work in Chatham County and meet certain financial criteria.

The Community HealthCare Center is modeled on the nationally successful Volunteers in Medicine (VIM) movement in which local communities develop free health care clinics staffed primarily by retired medical professionals willing to volunteer their services to care for the uninsured. The number of retirees willing to volunteer is expected to grow exponentially as the baby boomers come into retirement.

41,Extract field,Pfizer Petitions FDA to Recall Teva and Sandoz Generic Azithromycin Products to Correct Misbranding; --- Pfizer Charges Teva and Sandoz With Patent Infringement,,419 words,8 February 2006,05:06 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Feb. 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that it has filed a Citizen Petition alerting the FDA that generic azithromycin products sold by Teva Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. and Sandoz Inc. appear to be misbranded because their labels do not accurately describe the drugs' active ingredients.

Pfizer also has brought patent infringement actions against the two companies claiming that these products violate a recently-issued Pfizer patent. The Teva and Sandoz drugs are generic versions of Pfizer's antibiotic, Zithromax(R).","Pfizer's petition asks the FDA to initiate a recall of the Teva and Sandoz medicines to correct their misbranding. Pfizer also asks the agency to review the product approval applications filed by the two companies to ensure the information contained within them is accurate and complete and, if not, to take appropriate remedial action.

""Patients and physicians must be able to trust that the medicine in the bottle is the same as that which is described in the label,"" said Hank McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ""Pfizer wants to ensure that patients do not receive generic products that fail to meet FDA standards.""

In its patent infringement actions, Pfizer is claiming that the Teva and Sandoz products violate a recently-issued Pfizer patent covering azithromycin sesquihydrate. Pfizer is requesting that the court impose preliminary and permanent injunctions against further sales of the drugs.

Pfizer alleges that the drugs contain significant amounts of azithromycin sesquihydrate rather than the azithromycin monohydrate that they claim in their labels. Both Pfizer's Zithromax(R) and a generic azithromycin launched by the company's Greenstone subsidiary contain azithromycin dihydrate, which is the product approved in Pfizer's NDA. Zithromax's composition-of-matter patent in the U.S. expired in November 2005.

Teva and Sandoz each launched their generic products in November, 2005. In response to those launches, Greenstone introduced its generic azithromycin in the same month. Pfizer will continue to market its generic azithromycin through Greenstone.

NEW YORK, Feb. 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc is executing a wide-ranging strategy to transform all areas of its business, grow current and new medicines, drive productivity improvements and launch innovative patient-centered healthcare initiatives.

Addressing financial analysts here today, Pfizer outlined its drivers of value for 2006-2008, including growth of its key in-line medicines, an increasingly substantial contribution from new medicines, enhanced R&D productivity supporting a broad and promising pipeline of new medicines, and streamlining to reduce costs and speed decision-making in all parts of the company.

""This is a time of transformation for Pfizer and our industry,"" said Hank McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ""We are responding directly to the realities of our operating environment as we build value today while aggressively investing in the future. We have many significant opportunities ahead of us.

""We are rapidly adapting our business to effectively balance the demands of our customers, the needs of patients, and the interests of shareholders. Over the next three years, a new generation Pfizer will emerge, and our company will have the operating and financial strength to sustain value.""

Key Elements of Financial Forecast and Strategy to Build Shareholder Value

""Pfizer is aggressively transforming itself in all aspects of its business -- challenging the old ways and taking risks with new directions and innovations -- in sales, marketing, R&D, and manufacturing,"" said Vice Chairman David Shedlarz. ""While near-term results will be tempered by loss of exclusivity of older medicines, we see a bright, long-term future driven by growth of current and new medicines, productivity enhancements and new initiatives to enhance shareholder value.""

Revenue Growth. Pfizer expects sustained growth from key medicines and an increasingly large contribution from new medicines, which will offset the impact of loss of exclusivity. The company is reallocating resources to ensure the highest growth from its portfolio of important medicines.

Productivity Enhancements. The Adapting to Scale initiative will continue to produce substantial cost savings while creating a more efficient company. Adapting to Scale spans all functions, processes and geographies, with specific programs focused on enhancing R&D productivity, optimizing the field force, consolidating our network of manufacturing plants and optimizing the procurement of goods and services.

Initiatives to Enhance Shareholder Value. Pfizer will continue to use its strong cash flow from operations to enhance shareholder value. The company is focused on three important initiatives to leverage cash flow: increasing our dividend payout and yield, purchasing shares, and changing Pfizer's business portfolio, including the recently announced decision to explore strategic alternatives for Pfizer Consumer Healthcare (PCH).

Financial Guidance. Mr. Shedlarz said the financial impact of these and other transformational efforts are expected to result in the following guidance for 2006 performance:

  -- 2006 Revenues comparable to 2005, as growth of current and new products
     offsets revenue declines from loss of exclusivity and adverse foreign
     exchange
  -- 2006 Reported Diluted EPS of $1.52 to $1.56
  -- 2006 Adjusted Diluted EPS* comparable to 2005 at about $2.00, including
     the adverse impact of stock-option expensing and foreign exchange
  -- Mid-single-digit Adjusted Diluted EPS* growth in 2006, without the
     adverse impact of stock-option expensing and foreign exchange
  -- Modest improvement in 2006 of Adjusted Gross Margins** versus 2005
  -- Cost savings from the Adapting to Scale productivity initiative of
     about $2 billion in 2006
  -- 2006 operating cash flow of more than $16 billion
  -- 26 percent growth in the first-quarter 2006 dividend
  -- At least $1 billion in 2006 share purchases



Regarding performance in 2007 and 2008, Mr. Shedlarz provided the following guidance:

  -- Revenue growth is expected to resume in 2007, as contributions from new
     medicines and sustained in-line medicine growth more than offset the
     declining impact of loss of exclusivity
  -- Cost savings from the Adapting to Scale initiative of about $3.5
     billion by 2007 and of about $4 billion by 2008
  -- High-single-digit average annual growth in Adjusted Diluted EPS* over
     the two-year period of 2007-2008
  -- Continued strong growth in cash flow from operations anticipated to
     more than $19 billion by 2008



Earlier this week, Pfizer said it would explore strategic alternatives for its consumer healthcare business. ""This is the right time to undertake this review, given the premium the marketplace is placing on similar large, high-quality consumer businesses,"" Mr. Shedlarz said. ""We expect to make this decision in the third quarter of 2006.""

Pfizer Consumer Healthcare has a well-balanced product portfolio anchored by key brands including Listerine, Benadryl and Visine, and broad geographic presence. The business has maintained a strong, consistent financial performance, with high margins and stable cash flows. The business had 2005 segment revenues of $3.9 billion and pre-tax segment income of about $700 million. The median multiple of stock-price-to-2005 earnings for consumer healthcare companies is 21. If this multiple were applied to PCH, it could be valued as a stand-alone business at more than $10 billion.

     Pfizer Expects Strong Growth of Current and Emerging Medicines;
            New Growth to Offset Impact of Patent Expirations



Karen Katen, vice chairman and president of Pfizer Human Health, said, ""We are expecting strong growth for Lipitor, Celebrex and Lyrica in 2006, and we see excellent prospects for a number of new medicines we plan to launch this year. These include recently approved Sutent and Exubera, breakthrough treatments for cancer and diabetes, respectively, as well as our smoking cessation medicine Champix, which is currently under priority review by the FDA.""

Ms. Katen said the company expects sales of Lipitor, the world's most-prescribed medicine, to exceed $13 billion in 2006. ""We continue to enhance the Lipitor label -- including a new indication for reducing strokes -- and differentiate Lipitor with high-impact economic data demonstrating its benefits. In addition, Lipitor is performing well against generic simvastatin in many markets where the two medicines compete. This shows our efforts to communicate Lipitor's tremendous value in reducing cardiovascular events are effective. Given the large numbers of untreated patients, Lipitor has excellent opportunities to grow even further,"" Ms. Katen said.

""Going forward, we are going to highlight the benefits of Lipitor with new economic data demonstrating that Lipitor prevents costly cardiovascular events and associated healthcare costs while providing better overall cardiovascular health to patients,"" Ms. Katen said.

The company anticipates that sales of Celebrex will increase to more than $2 billion in 2006 and that sales of Lyrica will triple to more than $900 million. ""Celebrex is showing strong signs of growth with new prescription trends in the U.S. climbing steadily since October,"" Ms. Katen said. ""In the fourth quarter of 2005, we saw an increase of 8 percent in new Celebrex prescriptions while those for branded NSAIDs fell nearly 3 percent.""

Celebrex offers clear gastrointestinal (GI) advantages. ""Epidemiological data indicate that Celebrex has lower rates of GI bleeding requiring hospitalization than other highly prescribed pain relievers like naproxen and ibuprofen,"" Ms. Katen said. ""This GI profile also was confirmed in recent study results published in the British Medical Journal.""

To further characterize Celebrex's cardiovascular profile, Pfizer is funding the first large-scale safety study of Celebrex and traditional NSAIDs in patients with heart disease or those at high risk for heart disease. The Pfizer-funded study is being run independently by the Cleveland Clinic and will involve 20,000 patients worldwide.

Lyrica sales are outpacing those of other medicines that treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain. ""Physicians are prescribing Lyrica because of the positive experiences their patients are having,"" Ms. Katen said. ""In one survey, 70 percent of doctors cited rapid pain relief as an attribute they associate with Lyrica."" Pfizer is aggressively pursuing additional indications including generalized anxiety disorder, fibromyalgia and other neuropathic pain conditions.

Ms. Katen said Pfizer expects strong long-term performance for a number of new medicines, in many cases exceeding the expectations of financial analysts. Key product highlights include:

  -- Exubera, one of the most important innovations in diabetes treatment
     since the discovery of insulin in the 1920s.  Pfizer anticipates
     exceptional uptake for this fast-acting inhaled form of insulin due to
     better control of blood sugar without injections.
  -- Sutent, a novel treatment for two difficult-to-treat cancers.  Sutent
     offers new hope to patients who otherwise have no options.  Because of
     Sutent's unique mechanism of action, it has potential to treat other
     more common malignancies, and Pfizer is aggressively pursuing
     additional indications.
  -- Champix, Pfizer's smoking cessation medicine currently under FDA
     priority review, is expected to be a major advance in improving health
     worldwide.  Discovered and developed by Pfizer, Champix has
     demonstrated radically improved quit rates compared to other leading
     smoking cessation products.  Champix is unique in that it diminishes
     cravings while also decreasing the reward smokers get from cigarettes.



In addition, Pfizer expects to launch indiplon for insomnia, the antifungal medicine Eraxis, and Zeven, an antibiotic.

Pfizer has realigned its U.S. business in response to the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. In 2006, Pfizer estimates that Medicare Part D sales will represent about 20 percent of total U.S. sales, expanding to double that by 2008. Ms. Katen said Pfizer is well positioned in the Medicare marketplace with the majority of the company's key medicines represented on formularies.

""In addition, we restructured our U.S. field force to mirror the new regional structure under Medicare,"" Ms. Katen said. ""This has resulted in our representatives spending more time in the field with less duplication, enabling us to build even stronger relationships with physicians and Medicare prescription drug plans.""

Ms. Katen also said Pfizer is competing effectively in the generic market in the U.S. through the company's Greenstone subsidiary, which offers high-quality generic medicines to U.S. consumers.

""We are mindful that, with increasing life expectancy and a growing number of new medical innovations, the demand for healthcare will only increase,"" Ms. Katen said. ""At the same time, budgets will be further constrained, putting even greater pressure on the healthcare system. Through a series of initiatives, Pfizer is investing in prevention and wellness and helping patients proactively manage chronic diseases, which ultimately will better control total healthcare costs.""

Productivity Improvements Drive Pipeline Expansion

Dr. John LaMattina, president of Pfizer Global Research and Development, highlighted the company's progress in three areas: enhancing R&D productivity, advancing the company's pipeline of new medicines and expanding the scope of Pfizer R&D.

Dr. LaMattina said Pfizer is achieving productivity improvements through a focus on the quality and quantity of new medicine candidates. ""Our dual focus on improving both candidate output and candidate quality is setting the foundation for sustained R&D productivity in the years to come,"" he said. With these enhancements, Pfizer's objective is to ultimately deliver four medicines per year from the company's internal research efforts.

Pfizer's pipeline continues to grow and now consists of 235 total projects, including 152 novel compounds and 83 product enhancements. ""We have successfully streamlined and restructured our organization. Our pipeline is now 8 percent larger than at the end of 2004,"" Dr. LaMattina said.

Pfizer has completed 17 filings for approval of new medicines since 2001, 11 of which are approved and on the market. Dr. LaMattina added that the company expects two additional filings in 2006 -- one for maraviroc, a CCR-5 antagonist in Phase III studies for treatment of HIV/AIDS, and one through a licensing opportunity the company expects to announce in the first half of the year.

Dr. LaMattina said Pfizer is targeting three additional NDA filings in 2007, including torcetrapib/atorvastatin for cholesterol management, the schizophrenia medicine asenapine and ticilimumab, a new therapy for serious and life-threatening cancers.

In describing the expanding scope of Pfizer's R&D activities, Dr. LaMattina said the company has established a firm foothold in biologics with medicines including Genotropin and Macugen, among others. Sales of biologics in 2006 are expected to total $1.5 billion; Pfizer expects to triple revenues from biologics by 2010, placing the company among the top five producers of biologics. ""From a single program in 1996, our presence in biologics has grown to encompass more than 36 programs today, and we have a truly enviable pipeline of new medicines in this important area,"" Dr. LaMattina said.

           Pfizer Committed to Vigorous Global Defense Against
      Patent Infringement, Counterfeiting and Foreign Price Controls



Pfizer Vice Chairman and General Counsel Jeffrey Kindler reviewed the progress the company is making on the policy, legal and legislative fronts to effectively meet challenges in the company's operating environment, including threats to its intellectual property.

Regarding intellectual property, Mr. Kindler said, ""We will continue to aggressively defend our medicines from patent challenges and discourage unwarranted attacks on innovators. Many of these attacks are on our basic patents, and we have a 'zero-tolerance' policy for out-and-out patent infringement."" Mr. Kindler cited Pfizer's recent high-profile victories, most notably its defense of Lipitor in the U.S., U.K. and Spain. ""We have established an excellent track record in these cases that has validated our strategy for defending the patents protecting this critical medicine,"" he said.

Mr. Kindler also said Pfizer is combating the global threat of counterfeiting on multiple fronts, including focusing more resources on anti- counterfeiting investigations and working cooperatively with government and law enforcement agencies around the world to address the problem.

In the policy area, Mr. Kindler noted that Pfizer is addressing foreign price controls and access restrictions as a top priority. ""We are enlisting a broad array of allies, including the U.S. government, to advance policies supporting healthcare innovation around the world. With so much of the research-based pharmaceutical industry located in the U.S., we believe that this will become an even greater priority for keeping America at the forefront of health and economic prosperity.

""As the U.S. Department of Commerce has recognized, not only do foreign price controls and access restrictions harm patients in those countries, they also force American patients to bear a disproportionate share of the cost of research and development for new treatments,"" he said.

Conclusion. In summary, Hank McKinnell said, ""Pfizer is changing, our industry is changing, and healthcare systems around the world are changing. We believe that future healthcare will be rooted in prevention and wellness and early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases. All of these approaches play to Pfizer's strengths. With our highly talented workforce, Pfizer can be a catalyst in this evolution toward integrated, affordable and patient-centered healthcare.""

62,Extract field,"Pfizer Receives FDA Approval for Eraxis(TM) to Treat Candidemia, a Potentially Life-Threatening Bloodstream Infection; People with Weakened Immune Systems and Critically Ill Patients are Among Those at High Risk for Candidemia Infection; Eraxis Builds on Pfizer's Strength in Antifungal Medicines",,959 words,21 February 2006,10:44 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Feb. 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that Eraxis(TM) (anidulafungin) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat candidemia, a potentially life-threatening bloodstream infection. Candidemia is the most deadly of the common hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, with a mortality rate of approximately 40 percent.

In the United States, candidemia affects approximately one in 5,000 people, resulting in an estimated 60,000 cases each year. ""Bloodstream infections such as candidemia can spread quickly and are very dangerous, especially for patients with weakened immune systems,"" said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer. ""Physicians treating these seriously ill patients now have an important new treatment in Eraxis.""","Patients at high risk for candidemia and systemic candidiasis (Candida infection that spreads throughout the body) include those with compromised immune systems, stem-cell and organ-transplant recipients, patients on chemotherapy, patients with catheters, critically ill patients in intensive care units, surgical patients and patients on prolonged antibiotic therapy. In the U.S., patients with candidemia on average spend an additional 10 days in the hospital at an average increase in hospital charges of about $39,000 per patient.

""In the clinical trial setting, patients taking Eraxis for the treatment of candidemia had improved efficacy versus those taking fluconazole, making Eraxis an important addition to the options in antifungal treatment,"" said Dr. Annette Reboli, head of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, New Jersey, and lead clinical investigator. ""In addition, Eraxis has been shown to have a safety profile comparable to fluconazole and to be compatible with many medicines commonly used by patients with candidemia who have other serious health complications.""

Eraxis, an antifungal medicine of the echinocandin class, also was approved by the FDA to treat two additional infections caused by the Candida fungus-peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscesses -- as well as esophageal candidiasis, a fungal infection of the esophagus.

Eraxis builds upon Pfizer's extraordinary strength in medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases, particularly antifungal treatments. Pfizer's Diflucan(R) (fluconazole) has been the longstanding gold standard treatment for candidemia and other fungal infections, especially opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients. Pfizer's Vfend(R) (voriconazole), also a product of innovative Pfizer research, is a treatment for serious mold and yeast infections. Both Diflucan and Vfend are azole-type antifungal treatments.

Eraxis is the only medicine that has demonstrated improved efficacy versus fluconazole in a pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of candidemia. Eraxis was added to the company's antifungal portfolio through the acquisition of Vicuron in September 2005.

About Candida Infections

Candidemia is a systemic fungal infection that occurs when Candida organisms are present in the blood. The bloodstream may then spread Candida to organs and tissues throughout the body, causing systemic candidiasis.

Systemic candidiasis is difficult to diagnose and can cause organ failure, which may result in death. It can infect organs such as the kidneys, liver, bones, muscles, joints, spleen, or eyes.

Esophageal candidiasis is a fungal infection of the esophagus that is most common among people with compromised immune systems such as people with HIV/AIDS.

About Eraxis

Eraxis is an antifungal agent indicated for the treatment of candidemia and two other Candida infections, peritonitis (infection of the abdominal cavity) and intra-abdominal abscesses. Eraxis has not been studied in endocarditis, osteomyclitis, and meningitis due to Candida, and has not been studied in sufficient numbers of neutropenic patients (those with low white blood cell counts) to determine efficacy in this group. It was also approved for esophageal candidiasis, an infection of the esophagus caused by Candida (relapse rates post-therapy were higher for patients on Eraxis).

Important Safety Information

In clinical studies, Eraxis was as well tolerated as fluconazole and the total number of drug-related adverse events was comparable to fluconazole. The most common treatment-related adverse events for Eraxis in the candidemia study included lower than normal levels of potassium in the blood (3.1%), diarrhea (3.1%), and an increase in ALT (a liver enzyme) (2.3%). In the esophageal candidiasis study, the most common treatment-related adverse events for Eraxis were headache (1.3%) and an increase of GGT (a liver enzyme) (1.3%).

Eraxis has not been associated with renal toxicity, and has no clinically relevant drug-to-drug interactions. Eraxis also does not require dose adjustments based on gender, race, age, HIV status, hepatic insufficiency or renal insufficiency.

80,Extract field,Pfizer Completes Acquisition of Worldwide Rights to Exubera From sanofi-aventis; First Inhalable Form of Insulin for the Treatment of Adults with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes,,370 words,1 March 2006,10:23 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, March 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that it has acquired the sanofi-aventis worldwide rights to Exubera (inhaled human insulin). Pfizer received approval last month to market Exubera in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Exubera is the first inhalable form of insulin to be approved since the discovery of insulin in the 1920s, and represents a major advance in diabetes treatment.","Diabetes is a leading cause of death by disease worldwide and is currently at epidemic proportions. If blood sugar levels are not controlled, serious complications including heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and nerve damage will often develop. Approximately 194 million people worldwide have the disease.

Exubera is a rapid-acting, dry powder human insulin that is inhaled through the mouth into the lungs prior to eating, using a portable, handheld inhaler that when closed is about the size of an eyeglass case. Exubera is the result of one of the most rigorous and innovative diabetes development programs ever conducted.

In clinical trials, many patients using Exubera reported greater treatment satisfaction than patients taking insulin by injection. Even those patients who had used both Exubera and insulin injections or diabetes pills reported an overall preference for Exubera.

Pfizer and sanofi-aventis were previously in a worldwide alliance to co-develop, co-promote and co-manufacture Exubera. Pfizer has also acquired the sanofi-aventis rights to the Exubera insulin production facilities located in Frankfurt, Germany, which were previously jointly owned by Pfizer and sanofi-aventis. Exubera is currently a product of collaboration between Pfizer and Nektar Therapeutics.

90,Extract field,"'Only Lipitor Has Demonstrated Significant LDL Reductions and Cardiovascular Benefits for a Wide Range of Patients, With an Excellent Efficacy and Safety Profile Across the Full Dose Range'; Lipitor demonstrated plaque regression in REVERSAL trial",,425 words,13 March 2006,01:00 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"ATLANTA, March 13 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- In response to inquiries from the news media about the ASTEROID trial for Crestor presented today at the American College of Cardiology, Pfizer issued the following statement:","-- Only Lipitor has demonstrated significant LDL reductions and
     cardiovascular benefits for a wide range of patients, with an excellent
     efficacy and safety profile across the full dose range.

  -- This is not the first time a statin has demonstrated plaque regression.
     The REVERSAL trial compared treatment with Lipitor 80mg to another
     lipid lowering agent over 18 months.  In a subset of high-plaque burden
     patients, Lipitor demonstrated a 5.9% (P<.001) total plaque reduction
     with excellent toleration.

  -- It is not possible to compare the findings from ASTEROID with REVERSAL
     given ASTEROID's open label, single-arm design did not include a
     comparator.  In contrast, Lipitor has demonstrated significant LDL and
     cardiovascular benefits in well controlled clinical trials such as
     PROVE IT, TNT and IDEAL.

  -- Treatment practice has evolved significantly in the past several years,
     strongly supported by the results of the Lipitor clinical outcomes
     trials.  Studies like PROVE IT, TNT and IDEAL have conclusively
     demonstrated the benefit of intensive lipid lowering with Lipitor.

  -- The LDL levels reached in these studies, ranging from 60 to 80 mg/dL,
     are attainable only through intensive lipid lowering to a degree that
     cannot be matched with older, less efficacious therapies such as
     simvastatin.

  -- Lipitor has a proven record of safety and over 115 million patient
     years of experience that cannot be matched by any other medicine.

  -- Pfizer is using the IVUS technology in its large-scale Phase III
     torcetrapib/atorvastatin clinical trials program, which is studying
     some 25,000 patients at hundreds of medical centers worldwide.

  -- The results from these trials, which will report out in the near
     future, will provide additional information on the lipid hypotheses
     alluded to in ASTEROID in a well-controlled manner.

93,Extract field,New Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin Research Further Supports Raising 'Good' HDL Cholesterol,,"1,560 words",14 March 2006,09:11 AM,PR Newswire Europe,TWOTEN,,,English,Copyright ? 2006 PR Newswire Europe Limited.  All Rights Reserved.,"ATLANTA, March 14 /PRNewswire/ --


    -- Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin Clinical Trial Program is the Largest Ever
       Conducted by Pfizer: 25,000 Patients Enrolled in Studies Underway
       Around the World
    -- Pfizer Clinician: ""First Data to Show that there are Important
       Differences in Raising HDL Cholesterol Levels with Torcetrapib and
       Atorvastatin Depending on Whether it is Dosed in the Morning or
       Evening""
    -- TNT Trial Investigator: ""The TNT Sub-Analysis Suggests that HDL
       Cholesterol May Also Provide Important Therapeutic Benefits that May
       Result in Further Reductions in Cardiovascular Risk""","Pfizer said today that new data, involving its medicine in development torcetrapib/atorvastatin, provides important information on the benefit of raising HDL, or ""good"" cholesterol, while simultaneously lowering LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. These new findings may play a critical role in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease and potentially improving quality of life for patients. Data from three separate studies were presented this week at the American College of Cardiology meeting.

""As the first potential treatment to offer substantial HDL cholesterol elevations and significant LDL cholesterol lowering, torcetrapib/atorvastatin could well change how physicians manage their patients with cardiovascular disease,"" said Dr. John LaMattina, president of Pfizer Global Research and Development. ""This comprehensive clinical trial program will help determine if this hypothesis can offer patients the benefit of slowing atherosclerosis and ultimately preventing cardiovascular events beyond what can be achieved with Lipitor alone.""

It is estimated that 71 million Americans suffer from cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death in the United States. Most people with elevated cholesterol, a leading risk factor for heart attacks and strokes, are either not diagnosed or have not reached their target LDL levels with medication. In addition, research has shown that raising HDL-cholesterol may provide further benefits in the management of cardiovascular disease, which may have the potential to further reduce cardiovascular risk for patients.

Discovered and developed by Pfizer, torcetrapib works by blocking CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein) which is a protein that regulates cholesterol and is responsible for transferring cholesterol from its ""good"" HDL carrier to LDL, the ""bad"" carrier of cholesterol that results in plaque buildup in the arteries. Scientists believe that CETP inhibition raises HDL levels which results in cholesterol removal from the artery walls. Torcetrapib also lowers LDL cholesterol and LDL is known to cause heart attacks and stroke.

Presentation 1 - HDL and LDL as Predictors for CV Disease/Sub- Analysis of Lipitor TNT Study

The primary objective of the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study was to demonstrate the clinical benefits of intensive LDL cholesterol lowering. This sub-analysis of TNT found that patients treated to LDL cholesterol levels that were below current medical guidelines showed a direct relationship between HDL cholesterol levels and the frequency of cardiovascular events -- 1 mg/dL increase in HDL cholesterol levels was estimated to have an associated 2 percent reduction in the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

""This study further supports the potential benefits of managing HDL levels as an additional target for patients who are already receiving statin therapy,"" said Dr. Philip Barter, lead author, TNT sub-analysis, The Heart Institute in Sydney, Australia. ""While lowering LDL cholesterol remains a critical focus in cardiovascular disease prevention, the TNT sub-analysis suggests that HDL cholesterol may also provide important therapeutic benefits that may result in further reductions in cardiovascular risk.""

Presentation 2 - Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin: AM vs PM: Examining the Optimal Time of Dosing

Patients received either torcetrapib (100 mg) alone or torcetrapib (60 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) together, taken in the mornings or evenings, to determine if greater increases in HDL would be achieved based on the time of dosing. Torcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor is believed to be most effective when taken in the morning. Unlike most statins -- which are taken in the evening for maximum reduction in LDL cholesterol -- atorvastatin can be dosed anytime of the day and obtain equal LDL lowering effects.

Patients who took torcetrapib (60 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) in the morning experienced the most significant increase of 54.4 percent in HDL-cholesterol which was 12 percent higher than patients who took both torcetrapib and atorvastatin in the evening. Additionally, patients achieved a reduction in LDL cholesterol levels regardless of the time of day that therapy was taken.

""This is the first data to show that there are important differences in raising HDL cholesterol levels with torcetrapib depending on whether it is dosed in the morning or evening, and also highlights the flexibility and efficacy of atorvastatin,"" said Dr. Megan Gibbs, associate director of clinical research of Pfizer Global Research and Development.

Presentation 3 - Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin: Exploring Benefits of Lipid-Modifying Effects

Pfizer researchers also presented data from another study involving 493 patients to determine the effectiveness of torcetrapib (30, 60, 90 mg) either alone or in combination with atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, 80 mg).

In particular, the study addressed the HDL and LDL particle size and number using new technology -- nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Leading researchers believe both larger HDL and LDL particles, and lower numbers of LDL particles are less likely to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, or plaque build-up in the arteries, which is important in cardiovascular health. In this study, patients taking torcetrapib and atorvastatin together experienced a decrease in LDL cholesterol, and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels, as well as increases in the particle size of both HDL and LDL.

""These data provide important information on how CETP inhibition with torcetrapib affects the number and nature of lipid particles,"" said Dr. Tom Thuren, director of clinical development, Pfizer Global Research and Development. ""While the impact of these changes on cardiovascular risk is not currently known, we are diligently examining this and other areas in a large-scale clinical trial program.""

In this study, side effects of torcetrapib and Lipitor were similar to those most commonly associated with statin therapy. Patients taking 60 mg of torcetrapib with Lipitor also experienced an increase in systolic blood pressure of approximately 2 mm Hg, which will be further defined in ongoing phase 3 studies.

Pfizer's torcetrapib/atorvastatin development program is the largest and most comprehensive clinical trial program the company has ever undertaken and is studying some 25,000 patients at hundreds of medical centers worldwide at a cost of about US$800 million.

Lipitor Information

Lipitor is the most prescribed cholesterol-lowering therapy in the world, with nearly 107 million patient-years of experience.

It is used, in patients with multiple risk factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low HDL cholesterol or smoking, to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke and, along with a low-fat diet, to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is also used in patients with type 2 diabetes and one other risk factor such as high blood pressure, smoking, or other complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack.

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is not for women who are nursing, pregnant, or may become pregnant.

Patients who take Lipitor should tell their doctor about any unusual muscle pain or weakness. This could be a sign of serious muscle side effects. Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take. This may help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check patients' liver function before and during drug treatment, and may adjust the dose of Lipitor. Its most common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. They tend to be mild and often go away.

101,Pfizer1,"Lipitor's Safety Again Confirmed in Extensive Analysis of 49 Clinical Trials, Pfizer Says; Important and Timely Information for Physicians Intensively Treating Their Patients' Cholesterol; Patients Taking High Dose (80mg) Lipitor Reported Adverse Events Similar to Patients Taking Low Dose or Placebo",,937 words,17 January 2006,11:58 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 17 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Results of a recent analysis of 49 Lipitor clinical trials involving more than 14,000 patients showed that the overall rates of treatment-related adverse events reported by patients taking the highest dose of Lipitor were low and similar to those reported by patients who received placebo or the lowest dose of Lipitor. The analysis is published in the current edition of the American Journal of Cardiology.","""As more and more evidence has become available on the significant risks of high cholesterol, physicians are now being advised to aggressively lower their patients' cholesterol levels so that they get to their goal,"" said Dr. Gregg Larson, Pfizer vice president of U.S. cardiovascular medical. ""The cost of not getting to goal, both human and financial, can be very high. That's why this information is important and timely: it demonstrates to physicians that they can continue to feel confident in intensively treating their patients' cholesterol even with higher doses of Lipitor, as part of the drive to that all-important goal. As a result, patients get the benefit of even more reduction in their cardiovascular risk -- safely.""

The analysis, which included Lipitor clinical trials that were initiated and completed between 1992 and 2004, tracked the incidence of non-serious and serious muscle, liver and kidney adverse events and laboratory tests. The analysis compared 7,258 patients who received Lipitor 10mg to 4,798 patients taking Lipitor 80mg and 2,180 patients taking placebo. The average age of men and women in the analysis was 59 -- with the oldest patients over 90 years of age. The patients had varying degrees of cardiovascular risk.

  Results include:
  * Lipitor was well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events related
    to the digestive system.
  * There was no direct relationship observed between the dose of Lipitor
    and the frequency of muscle adverse events.
  * The incidence of myalgia (muscle weakness or pain) was low and similar
    in patients taking Lipitor 10mg and 80mg doses.
  * Myopathy (muscle weakness or pain combined with a 10-fold increase in
    muscle enzymes and more severe than myalgia) was rare and unlikely to be
    dose related in Lipitor patients.
  * There were no reported cases of rhabdomyolysis (a rare form of skeletal
    muscle breakdown) in patients taking Lipitor.  In Lipitor-treated
    patients, the overall incidence of elevated liver enzymes was low.
    However, elevated liver enzymes were more frequently observed in
    patients taking 80mg doses of Lipitor compared to patients taking 10mg
    doses of Lipitor.



As in all Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials, adverse events were recorded by the investigators on the basis of symptoms reported by the patient, physical examination findings and abnormal results of any laboratory tests. The adverse events were recorded during the treatment phase and up to 30 days after trial discontinuation.

Since 2004, the Lipitor 80mg dose has also been studied in the Treating to New Targets Trial (TNT) and the Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) clinical trials which have completed and published.

Since the introduction of Lipitor nearly nine years ago, its safety and effectiveness have been supported through an extensive clinical trial program, the Atorvastatin Landmark Program, with more than 400 ongoing and completed trials involving more than 80,000 patients. Lipitor is the most-prescribed cholesterol-lowering therapy in the world with more than 109 million patient years of experience.

""The knowledge that we have gained about cardiovascular disease as a result of this comprehensive clinical trial program has been instrumental in helping us better understand the benefits of the full dose range of Lipitor, which can help both physicians and patients chart the right course for cholesterol treatment."" said Dr. Larson.

About Lipitor

Lipitor(R) (atorvastatin calcium) is a prescription drug. It is used in patients with multiple risk factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol or smoking, to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke and, along with a low-fat diet, to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is used in patients with type 2 diabetes and one other risk factor such as high blood pressure, smoking, or other complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack. Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is not for women who are nursing, pregnant, or may become pregnant

If you take Lipitor, tell your doctor if you feel any unusual muscle pain or weakness. This could be a sign of serious muscle side effects. Tell your doctor about all medicines you take. This may help avoid serious drug interactions. Your doctor should do blood tests to check your liver function before and during drug treatment and may adjust your dose. The most common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. They tend to be mild and often go away.

NEW YORK, Jan. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 financial results today that reflect operating and financial strength, with performance exceeding expectations, driven by in-line medicines, new medicines, and accelerated cost savings, all while promising candidates continue to advance through the company's pipeline.

""We are supporting our key in-line and newly launched medicines, driving important new medicines through the pipeline and taking a series of specific actions to build Pfizer's value,"" said Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer. ""We completed the year with positive news on many fronts -- including double-digit full-year worldwide growth of Lipitor; an exceptional Lyrica launch in the U.S.; priority-review status for two potential breakthrough medicines, Sutent for cancer and Champix for smoking cessation; favorable decisions in Lipitor patent cases; and a 26-percent dividend increase for the first quarter of 2006. Our strategy of driving growth in our in-line medicines and investing in promising new medicines is the essence of the new Pfizer. We will continue to focus on enhancing value for our shareholders and meeting patients' needs worldwide.""

Dr. McKinnell said there were two primary drivers for Pfizer's better- than-expected performance in the quarter: better revenue performance in the Human Health business; and operating expense savings, coupled with the acceleration of the ""Adapting to Scale"" (AtS) cost savings to $800 million in 2005, which is double the goal for the year.

""While we are pleased that Pfizer's performance in 2005 exceeded previous expectations, investors should be aware that the factors driving Pfizer's performance may differ materially in 2006,"" Dr. McKinnell added. ""We look forward to providing a full briefing on our 2006 financial guidance, strategy, products, and pipeline at our analyst meeting in New York on February 10. We enter the new year with renewed determination to capitalize on all the opportunities we see to bring our innovative medicines to those who need them.""

Portfolio, Pipeline Position Human Health for Future Success

""2005 has been a challenging year for Pfizer Human Health,"" said Karen Katen, vice chairman of Pfizer Inc and president of Pfizer Human Health. ""However, fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 results indicate that we are well-positioned for the future, with a solid in-line portfolio and a rich pipeline of innovative new medicines.""

Loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of certain key medicines, uncertainty related to Celebrex, and the suspension of Bextra sales cumulatively reduced 2005 worldwide revenue by $5.7 billion. As a result, total Pfizer Human Health revenue declined $1.8 billion, or 4 percent, for full-year 2005 compared to full-year 2004. In the U.S., Human Health revenue declined 12 percent for the full-year 2005 compared to the same period in 2004.

Excluding the major medicines that lost exclusivity in the U.S. in 2004 and 2005 and the selective COX-2 inhibitors, Human Health adjusted revenues(2) grew 11 percent worldwide and 10 percent in the U.S. for full-year 2005 compared to 2004. The successful launches of seven new medicines over the past two years are enabling Pfizer to replenish our portfolio. The combined sales of these products (Inspra, Caduet, Olmetec, Macugen, Revatio, Zmax, and Lyrica) generated $284 million in fourth-quarter 2005 revenue and $632 million in full-year 2005 revenue worldwide.

Many of Pfizer's top medicines achieved double-digit growth worldwide in 2005 compared to 2004 across many therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular/metabolic diseases (Lipitor up 12 percent, Caduet up 272 percent); central nervous system disorders (Geodon up 26 percent, Relpax up 38 percent); infectious and respiratory diseases (Zyvox up 33 percent, Vfend up 38 percent); oncology (Aromasin up 73 percent); and ophthalmology (Xalatan/Xalacom up 12 percent).

Fourth-Quarter Portfolio Highlights

The cardiovascular portfolio continues to perform well. Cardiovascular sales include another billion-dollar quarter for Norvasc and continued momentum for Caduet, which achieved 323-percent revenue growth worldwide in the fourth quarter to $65 million. Worldwide sales of Lipitor totaled $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth of 3 percent over the previous year's quarter, a difficult comparison in light of Lipitor's 23- percent revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2004, exacerbated by four fewer business days in the 2005 quarter. Full-year sales of $12.2 billion reflected 12-percent growth over 2004.

In the recently published IDEAL study, Lipitor was shown to be numerically superior to Zocor in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. This difference fell just short of statistical significance (p=0.07 vs. significance at p=0.05). Lipitor did achieve statistically significant improvements in major secondary endpoints, including a 13-percent reduction in major cardiovascular events and a 17-percent reduction in non-fatal heart attacks for patients taking Lipitor 80 mg compared to patients taking simvastatin (Zocor) 20 and 40 mg. These results affirm that intensive lipid- lowering with Lipitor 80 mg can safely provide benefits beyond the most commonly prescribed doses of Zocor (20 and 40 mg) in patients with coronary artery disease.

The performance of the central nervous system portfolio was fueled by the launch of Lyrica. Since its September launch, more than 500,000 prescriptions have been written for Lyrica in the U.S. as of December 23, 2005. Lyrica had already gained more than a 7-percent new-prescription share of the U.S. anti- epileptic market as of December 23, continuing its performance as one of Pfizer's most successful pharmaceutical launches. This mirrors the outstanding launch performance seen globally. On a worldwide basis, Geodon exhibited strong full-year growth of 26 percent. This performance far outpaced the rate of market growth. In the U.S., Geodon is the second- fastest-growing atypical anti-psychotic oral medication in new-prescription volume as of November year-to-date. Its balance of powerful efficacy and a favorable metabolic profile positions it for further growth.

In the ophthalmology portfolio, the 9-percent worldwide growth in audited sales of Xalatan/Xalacom outpaced market growth (IMS MIDAS data for the twelve months ending November 2005). These medicines continue to lead the worldwide glaucoma market with a 35.7-percent share of revenues during the same period. Pfizer recently launched the first fully validated glaucoma risk calculator, which will help physicians identify patients with ocular hypertension who are most likely to progress to glaucoma, and determine whether to initiate earlier therapy. Macugen has become an important treatment in the U.S. for wet age- related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in people over 60. While new competitors are expected to enter the market, Macugen has a strong foothold with more than 40,000 patients treated to date. Macugen's favorable safety profile has been maintained for more than two years of clinical testing and marketing.

Despite decreased usage in prescription pain medications, Celebrex continues to be a leader in this field with a 46-percent share of U.S. anti- inflammatory sales and a 22-percent share worldwide for November 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Celebrex was the fastest-growing medicine in the U.S. anti-inflammatory market. Pfizer is currently supporting the Cleveland Clinic's 20,000-patient prospective study to definitively evaluate the relative safety of Celebrex and two older pain medications in patients with heart disease or at high risk of heart disease.

Worldwide full-year 2005 Viagra sales declined 2 percent. Fourth-quarter 2005 sales declined 8 percent, versus the comparable period in 2004, reflecting slower growth in the overall erectile-dysfunction (ED) market and competition from other products. Viagra continues to lead the ED market and is capturing six out of ten new prescriptions for ED in the U.S. through November 2005 year-to-date. Pfizer is supporting consumer ED education with the recent launch of a new unbranded educational campaign in the U.S.

Rich Pipeline of New Medicines Continues to Advance

""We continue to make excellent progress toward our goal of filing 20 major new medicines in the U.S. in the five-year period ending in 2006,"" said Dr. John LaMattina, President of Pfizer Global Research and Development.

In addition to the seven products launched in 2004 and 2005, six additional products are under review by the FDA. Priority review has been granted for three of these -- Sutent (sunitinib), Champix (varenicline), and Eraxis (anidulafungin).

  * Sutent is an oral agent with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity
    that may offer significant advantage to physicians treating patients
    with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and Gleevec-resistant
    gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

  * Champix, a novel partial nicotinic agonist for smoking cessation, has
    been shown to be more effective than the only other oral anti-smoking
    prescription medicine.

  * In a recent study, the antifungal agent Eraxis has shown significant
    benefit over fluconazole in the treatment of candidemia and invasive
    candidiasis and has received an approvable letter from the FDA for
    esophageal candidiasis.

  Three other products are currently under review by the FDA:

  * Exubera, the inhaled insulin drug for type 1 and type 2 diabetes,
    represents the first non-injectable form of insulin available for
    diabetics.  It has been recommended for approval by the FDA advisory
    committee and for marketing authorization by the Committee for Medicinal
    Products in Europe.  Pfizer has reached an agreement to acquire sanofi-
    aventis's share of worldwide rights to Exubera, as well as the insulin
    production facilities located in Frankfurt previously jointly owned by
    the two companies.

  * Indiplon is filed for two NDAs for the treatment of adult insomnia, in
    immediate-release and modified-release formulations.

  * We have received an approvable letter from the FDA for Zeven
    (dalbavancin), a once-weekly intravenous antibiotic for the treatment
    of complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by Gram-
    positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
    aureus.  This is Pfizer's second major product filing resulting from the
    recent acquisition of Vicuron.



""And we reached several important milestones during the fourth quarter in our ongoing efforts to bring new innovative therapies to patients around the world,"" said Dr. LaMattina.

Ticilimumab (CP-675,206), an anti-CTLA4 receptor antagonist, began Phase 3 testing in December. The compound is a monoclonal antibody and another addition in Pfizer's growing pipeline of large-molecule biologics. Ticilimumab may offer an important new option for treating metastatic melanoma, which has a five-year survival rate of less than 10 percent.

In 2005, Pfizer extended our long history of successful alliances and acquisitions with a series of agreements with Angiosyn, BioRen, Coley, Idun, Incyte, Renovis, Rigel, and Vicuron, several of which are already demonstrating strong results. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Pfizer began two Phase 3 trials for non-small-cell lung cancer using a novel anti-cancer agent PF-3512676 (formerly CpG 7909), licensed from Coley Pharmaceutical Group. Based on Phase 2 survival data, this compound may offer a significant advancement over current therapies in treating non-small-cell lung cancer.

Pfizer also entered a global collaborative research and licensing agreement with Incyte Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2005, giving us exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to a portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds for the potential treatment of inflammation. The most advanced compound is currently in Phase 2a studies in rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-resistant obese patients.

Leveraging Financial Strength

""Pfizer is undertaking a series of actions to employ the company's strong positive cash flow for the short- and long-term benefit of shareholders,"" said David Shedlarz, vice chairman. ""Given the strength of our operations, in December 2005 we increased our dividend for the first quarter of 2006 by 26 percent to 24 cents per share, while continuing to invest for long-term growth. With this increase, Pfizer will have increased dividends every year for 39 consecutive years. In 2005, we repatriated nearly $37 billion in foreign earnings, which Pfizer is using to enhance its balance sheet and invest in business opportunities. In addition, the company purchased nearly $4 billion in common stock in 2005, and it will continue to buy back its stock in 2006. Pfizer's sterling triple-A credit rating was also reaffirmed by Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

""With these and other actions, we are demonstrating to shareholders our commitment to work to enhance the value of their investment in Pfizer,"" Mr. Shedlarz concluded.

""Pfizer's earnings performance in the fourth quarter reflected operational flexibility, exceeding the estimate we announced in October 2005 for a number of reasons,"" said Alan Levin, senior vice president and chief financial officer. ""Human Health revenues were stronger than previously forecast, reflecting an unexpected two-week delay in the introduction of azithromycin (Zithromax) generics in the U.S., strong early market acceptance of Lyrica, and better-than-anticipated performance in certain key markets (Japan and Germany) and in certain key products (Zyrtec and Norvasc). The fourth quarter of 2005 had four fewer business days than the fourth quarter of 2004; this is reflected in more tempered revenues and operating expenditures for the quarter. Full-year 2005 figures reflect a comparable number of days to 2004.

""Cost of sales for the quarter remained under pressure, although the impact of changes in the geographic, product, and segment mix of our products was partially mitigated by the favorable impact of foreign exchange during the quarter. The modest rate of growth in Selling, Informational and administrative expenses and the decline in Research and Development expenditures is due in part to greater savings associated with our Adapting to Scale (AtS) initiative. For the full year, AtS savings of approximately $800 million were realized, double our original goal for the year. We also achieved approximately $4.2 billion in synergies through 2005 in connection with our acquisition and integration of Pharmacia Corporation.

""Relative to prior expectations, fourth-quarter and full-year reported net income and diluted EPS reflect our enhanced operating performance during the quarter, partially offset by higher AtS implementation costs,"" Mr. Levin concluded.

       Pfizer Continues Aggressive Defense of Intellectual Property
                With Important Lipitor, Norvasc Victories



In December 2005, Pfizer prevailed in a U.S. court decision involving a patent challenge to Lipitor, the world's most popular cholesterol-lowering medicine. The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware determined that two U.S. patents covering atorvastatin, the active ingredient in Lipitor, are valid and infringed by the product of generic manufacturer Ranbaxy Labs LTD (Ranbaxy), thus protecting Lipitor's exclusivity until June 2011.

The U.S. decision marked one more major victory over Ranbaxy, which is using legal challenges in an attempt to overturn Pfizer's atorvastatin patents in the U.S. and many other markets. In October 2005, the United Kingdom's High Court upheld the exclusivity of the basic patent covering atorvastatin. The ruling prohibits Ranbaxy from introducing a generic version of atorvastatin in the U.K. until the patent expires in November 2011. Both the U.S. and U.K. decisions have been appealed.

""Lipitor represents nothing less than one of the most important medical breakthroughs from pharmaceutical research, and the courts are sending a clear message that the legal system should support and encourage this kind of innovation,"" said Jeffrey Kindler, vice chairman and general counsel. ""We continue to believe that policymakers should examine a system in which generic companies can take as many 'shots on goal' as they wish, employing lawyers, not medical researchers, around the world to undermine confidence in research- based companies and the jobs they support. Our only course is to aggressively defend our patents and stand for principles we believe in, on behalf of the patients we serve and the future of medical innovation.""

In a separate case, Pfizer announced yesterday that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois upheld Pfizer's U.S. patent covering amlodipine besylate, the active ingredient in Norvasc, which had been challenged by the generic manufacturer Apotex.

               Disaster Relief Efforts, Access Initiatives
                     Highlight Corporate Citizenship



Pfizer continues to make progress in its initiatives to expand access to medicines and healthcare resources and to demonstrate excellence in corporate citizenship.

During 2005, the company made substantial contributions to the relief and recovery efforts in response to an unprecedented series of natural disasters, including the Asian tsunami, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the U.S. Gulf States, and the earthquake that struck Pakistan and India. In partnership with relief organizations and local authorities in the affected regions, Pfizer and its colleagues donated funds, medicines, and healthcare supplies and supported the rebuilding of critical healthcare infrastructure.

The company also advanced healthcare programs and partnerships in the developing world during 2005, including a program to train medical professionals across Africa in diagnosis and management of patients with HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis; a multi-country initiative to eliminate trachoma, the world's leading cause of preventable blindness; and a program in 42 developing countries to train healthcare providers in the treatment of opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS.

Pfizer Changing to Meet Changing Times

""While 2005 was one of the most difficult years in memory, it ended well,"" Dr. McKinnell concluded. ""2005 will be seen as a pivotal year in Pfizer's history -- the last year of the old Pfizer. We are once again doing what every generation of Pfizer colleagues has had to do since the late 1800s -- change our company to meet changing times.""

  (1) The above financial statement presents the three-month and twelve-
      month periods ended December 31 of each year. Subsidiaries operating
      outside the United States are included for the three-month and twelve-
      month periods ended November 30 of each year.

  (2) As required, the estimated value of Merger-related in-process research
      and development charges (IPR&D) is expensed at acquisition date.  In
      2005, we expensed $1.7 billion of IPR&D, of which $1.4 billion related
      to our acquisition of Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the third
      quarter and $250 million related to our acquisition of Idun
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the second quarter.  In 2004, we expensed
      $1.1 billion of IPR&D, of which $920 million related to our
      acquisition of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. in the first quarter.

  (3) Other (income)/deductions -- net in the fourth quarter of 2004
      includes a charge of $691 million in connection with an intangible
      asset impairment related to Depo-Provera. Other (income)/deductions --
      net in 2005 includes an impairment charge of $1.2 billion related to
      the developed technology rights and the write-off of machinery and
      equipment for Bextra, a selective COX-2 inhibitor.  Other
      (income)/deductions -- net in 2004 includes a charge of $691 million
      in connection with an intangible asset impairment related to
      Depo-Provera and $369 million in connection with certain litigation-
      related charges.

  (4) Provision for taxes on income in 2005 includes tax benefits associated
      with the resolution of certain tax positions ($586 million) and taxes
      on the repatriation of foreign earnings ($1.7 billion).

  (5) In December 2005, we adopted the provisions of the Financial
      Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting
      for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), a new
      accounting interpretation issued in March 2005.  As a result, we
      recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $40 million ($25 million, net of
      tax) for costs associated with the eventual retirement of certain
      facilities. This charge is reported as a one-time cumulative effect of
      a change in accounting principle in the fourth quarter of 2005.

  (1) Human Health adjusted revenues, which excludes the revenues of
      selective COX-2 inhibitors and major products which have lost
      exclusivity in the U.S. since the beginning of 2004, is an alternative
      view of our Human Health revenue performance and we believe that
      investors' understanding of Human Health revenue growth is enhanced by
      disclosing this performance measure.  Zithromax, Neurontin, Diflucan
      and Accupril/Accuretic recently lost their U.S. exclusivity and, as is
      typical in the pharmaceutical industry, this has resulted in a
      dramatic decline in revenues due to generic competition.  Celebrex and
      Bextra, as a result of a recent regulatory evaluation of the risks and
      benefits of all COX-2 medicines, have also experienced a significant
      decline in sales.  Specifically, the regulatory review of and
      conclusions regarding Celebrex have resulted in a reduction in sales
      this year as physicians evaluate the evolving information on the risks
      and benefits of all NSAIDs and revised labeling, and on April 7, 2005,
      the FDA requested the suspension of Bextra sales and marketing based
      on its assessment of an unfavorable risk/benefit profile due to the
      additional increased risk of rare, serious skin reactions compared to
      other NSAIDs. We believe that excluding the impact of these products
      assists the reader in understanding the underlying strength of the
      balance of our diverse Human Health product portfolio in 2005.
      Because of its non-standardized definition, this adjusted Human Health
      revenues measure has limitations as it may not be comparable with the
      calculation of similar measures of other companies.  This additional
      revenue measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for
      the U.S. GAAP comparison of Human Health revenue growth.

                                PFIZER INC
                    SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

  1)  Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues



Changes in foreign-exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2005 relative to the same period in the prior year had a nominally favorable impact on revenue growth of $36 million, or 0.2%. The weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the euro, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, and British pound, for the twelve months of 2005 compared to the twelve months of 2004 favorably impacted full-year 2005 revenues by $945 million, or 1.8%.

2) Impact of Accounting Calendar on Revenues

Pfizer's accounting calendar had three additional business days in the first quarter relative to 2004. Pfizer's second and third fiscal quarters of 2005 had the same number of business days as the prior year. The fourth quarter, however, had four fewer business days than the prior year (six fewer calendar days).

3) Change in Cost of Sales

Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 17.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 15.8% in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in the cost of sales margin principally reflects unfavorable geographic, segment, and product mix; adverse changes in production volume; and AtS costs ($87 million); partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange.

Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 16.6% for the twelve months of 2005 from 14.4% for the twelve months of 2004. The increase reflects unfavorable geographic, segment, and product mix; adverse changes in production volume; AtS costs ($124 million); and costs associated with Bextra ($73 million), among other factors.

4) Costs Relating to Adapting to Scale Productivity Initiative

Costs relating to the Adapting to Scale (AtS) initiative were $470 million and $780 million, pre-tax, for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2005. We expect the costs associated with this multi-year effort to continue through 2008 and to total $4 billion to $5 billion, on a pre-tax basis. The actions associated with the AtS initiative will include restructuring charges -- such as asset impairments, exit costs, and severance and severance-related costs -- and associated implementation costs, such as accelerated depreciation charges, primarily associated with plant network optimization efforts, and expenses associated with system and process standardization and the expansion of shared services.

5) Merger-Related Costs

Pharmacia merger-related costs totaled $928 million for 2005. Cumulative costs from 2002 through 2005 were $5.4 billion, consistent with expectations at the time of the acquisition. Merger-related synergies through 2005 totaled approximately $4.2 billion. Pharmacia merger-related initiatives are essentially complete, and we will not incur material Pharmacia merger-related costs going forward.

  * Certain 2004 amounts were reclassified to conform to the 2005
    presentation.



In connection with the decision to suspend sales of Bextra in the first quarter of 2005, we recorded a charge of $1.1 billion relating to the impairment of Bextra's intangible assets for developed technology rights and the write-off of machinery and equipment of $5 million.

In the third quarter of 2004, Pfizer recorded a litigation-related charge of $369 million related to the resolution of claims against Quigley Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a non-cash charge of $691 million upon determining that an indefinite-lived intangible asset relating to Depo-Provera had become impaired.

7) Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate used in calculating reported income for 2005 is 29.7%. The effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted income(1) is 22.2%. The difference between the adjusted tax rate and the reported tax rate primarily reflects the tax impact on foreign earnings repatriated pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act, resolution of certain tax positions, as well as the tax impacts of purchase accounting and the Bextra impairment.

8) Share-Purchase Program

We believe that purchase of our stock is an excellent investment opportunity. Since the beginning of 1999, Pfizer has purchased more than $35.6 billion of its common stock. In the second quarter of 2005, the company completed the $5 billion share-purchase program authorized in October 2004. On June 23, 2005, Pfizer announced the authorization of a new $5 billion share-purchase program. By the end of 2005, Pfizer had purchased approximately 22 million shares valued at approximately $493 million under the new program. In total, the company purchased nearly 144 million shares of common stock, valued at $3.8 billion, during 2005. We remain committed to completing our new $5 billion share-purchase program.

114,Pfizer1,"European Commission Approves Exubera(R) (Inhaled Human Insulin) for Treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes; CEO McKinnell: 'Exubera is a Major, First-of-its-Kind, Medical Breakthrough That Marks Another Critical Step Forward in the Treatment of Diabetes, a Disease That Has Taken an Enormous Human and Economic Toll Worldwide'; First Non-Injectable, Inhalable Insulin Approved Since the Discovery of Insulin; Simple-to-Use, Hand-Held Device and Easy Option for Those Failing Other Therapies; New Treatment Option for People with Diabetes Who Are Not Adequately Controlled with Diabetes Pills or Insulin Injections; Diabetes is the Fourth Leading Cause of Death Worldwide and More Than 48 Million People in Europe Suffer from Diabetes-the Most Common Cause of Blindness, Amputations, Kidney Failure, Heart Attack and Nerve Damage",,"1,370 words",26 January 2006,12:04 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that the European Commission has approved Exubera (inhaled human insulin) for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Exubera is the first non-injectable, inhalable form of insulin to be approved since the discovery of insulin in the 1920s, and represents a major advance in diabetes treatment.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes has reached epidemic proportions and affects approximately 48 million people in Europe alone. People with diabetes often suffer from debilitating complications due to uncontrolled blood sugar levels including heart disease, amputation, blindness and kidney failure. The direct healthcare costs associated with diabetes are estimated to be around $286 billion worldwide, with the majority of these costs linked to treating diabetes-related complications.","Since its discovery more than 80 years ago, insulin has been the gold standard treatment for diabetes. In order to achieve tight blood sugar control, insulin is often administered before meals to mimic the body's natural insulin response to food. Healthcare providers and patients have been reluctant to initiate or intensify insulin therapy when it is required due to the need for daily injections.

""Exubera is a major, first-of-its-kind, medical breakthrough that marks another critical step forward in the treatment of diabetes, a disease that has taken an enormous human and economic toll worldwide,"" said Hank McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ""The global incidence of diabetes is currently at epidemic levels. Millions of patients are not achieving or maintaining acceptable blood sugar levels, despite the availability of current therapies. Exubera meets a critical medical need by offering a highly effective and needle-free alternative to diabetes pills and insulin injections to manage this complicated, debilitating disease.""

Exubera is a fast-acting, dry powder formulation of human insulin that is inhaled into the lungs via the mouth before meals using a simple-to-use, hand-held device that does not require batteries or electricity. The device, which weighs four ounces and is about the size of a carrying case for a pair of eye glasses, is designed to deliver an accurate and precise dose of insulin each time it is used.

Exubera is the result of one of the most rigorous and innovative diabetes development programs ever and Pfizer's investment now stands at over $1 billion. Pfizer invested in two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities -- the world's largest insulin plant in Frankfurt, Germany, and a high-tech facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, U.S. -- well ahead of regulatory actions, so that the product can reach patients as quickly as possible.

The efficacy and safety profile of Exubera was studied in more than 2,500 adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes for an average duration of 20 months. In studies in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, Exubera was shown to be as effective as injectable insulin in achieving glycemic control. In adults with type 2 diabetes who are not sufficiently controlled with commonly used oral therapies, Exubera has been shown to provide greater improvements in glycemic control. In addition, patients who took Exubera reported greater overall treatment satisfaction and acceptance compared to insulin injections or oral therapies.

""This is really good news for physicians and patients. It is truly a clinical and scientific milestone -- being able to give insulin without needles,"" said Chantal Mathieu, Professor of Endocrinology, University of Leuven, Belgium. ""Physicians face many challenges with insulin therapy due to patients' reluctance to take injections, which up until now, was the only way to take insulin. With Exubera, patients now have another opportunity to take control of their blood sugar and take an active role in managing this complicated disease.""

About Exubera

To further support the effective use of Exubera, Pfizer is investing in extensive educational programs to support healthcare professionals and patients.

Exubera is a product of a collaboration between Pfizer Inc and Nektar Therapeutics. Pfizer recently reached an agreement to acquire the sanofi-aventis worldwide rights to Exubera. The two companies were previously in a worldwide alliance to co-develop, co-promote and co-manufacture Exubera.

In the European Union, Exubera has been approved for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes (greater than 18 years of age) not adequately controlled with oral antidiabetic agents and requiring insulin therapy. Exubera is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in addition to long or intermediate acting injectable insulin, for whom the potential benefits of adding inhaled insulin outweigh the potential safety concerns.

Exubera is pending approval in the U.S. In September 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee recommended that Exubera should be approved for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

There are two major forms of diabetes -- type 1 and type 2. In type 1, which typically develops in childhood, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas have been destroyed leading to a complete lack of insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the most common and progressive form of the disease, the body does not effectively use nor produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, and eventually most people with type 2 diabetes will need insulin to achieve blood sugar control.

Important Safety Information about Exubera

The safety profile and tolerability of Exubera have been extensively studied in clinical trials. Adverse events throughout the clinical development program were generally mild to moderate, and discontinuation rates were low.

Patients should not take Exubera if they have poorly controlled or unstable lung disease, or if they smoke or have stopped smoking less than six months prior to starting Exubera treatment. If a patient starts smoking or resumes smoking, he or she must stop using Exubera and see a health care provider about a different treatment.

Before starting treatment with Exubera, a health care provider will carry out a simple test to check lung function. The test involves exhaling into a measuring device. This will help to find out if Exubera is the right treatment for individual patients. Once a patient starts treatment, it is recommended that a health care provider should check lung function again at six months (see full prescribing information).

A small decrease in lung function may occur during Exubera treatment although symptoms might not be noticeable. This change occurs within the first months of treatment and should not worsen as treatment is continued.

Like all medicines, Exubera can cause side effects. As with all forms of insulin, a possible side effect of Exubera is low blood sugar levels.

Some patients have reported a mild cough while taking Exubera, which occurred within seconds to minutes after Exubera inhalation. Coughing occurred less frequently as patients continued to use Exubera.

Consecutive inhalation of three 1mg unit dose blisters causes a significantly higher insulin exposure than inhalation of one 3mg unit dose blister. Therefore, three 1mg unit dose blisters should not be substituted for one 3mg unit dose blister.

119,Pfizer1,"Pfizer's Lyrica Receives Positive Opinion From CHMP for the Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Adults; Under-Recognized, Poorly-Treated and Stigmatized Condition Frequently Associated with High Levels of Patient Distress and Impairment; UK Expert: Psychological and Physical Effects of GAD Disrupt Work and Personal Relationships and Make it Difficult to Carry on with Everyday Activities",,544 words,27 January 2006,11:24 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization of Lyrica(R) (pregabalin), a novel mechanism for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults.

The CHMP's positive recommendation will be reviewed by the European Commission, which has authority to approve medicines for the European Union. Pfizer anticipates a final decision from the Commission in the coming months.","""Though GAD has been formally recognized by the medical community and is frequently associated with high levels of distress and impairment, the condition often goes undetected and untreated,"" said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer. ""It is estimated that only one-third of those who suffer from this condition seek treatment despite the significant impact on patient quality of life. We are pleased that the CHMP has recognized the potential therapeutic benefits of Lyrica in treating this serious medical condition.""

GAD, which affects an estimated five percent of people at some point in their lives, is a psychiatric disorder characterized by excessive worry as well as physical symptoms such as poor sleep, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability and restlessness. GAD affects slightly more women than men, and symptoms are often chronic and worsen during times of stress. GAD occurs more frequently in patients with chronic medical illnesses, particularly in connection with pain syndromes. The direct annual healthcare costs associated with GAD in Europe are approximately $1.5 billion.

""Despite frequent visits to their doctor, GAD patients are still very poorly treated."" said Dr. Stuart Montgomery, Professor of Psychiatry, Imperial College School of Medicine, University of London. ""The psychological and physical effects of GAD disrupt work and personal relationships and make it difficult to carry on with everyday activities. Accurate diagnosis of GAD is important since prolonged anxiety increases impairment and worsens the outcome of co-existing physical illnesses.""

Lyrica has been approved for various neuropathic pain indications including peripheral neuropathic pain, diabetic and postherpetic neuropathic pain and adjunctive therapy for epilepsy in more than 50 countries outside of the United States. The most common adverse events in Lyrica's clinical development program were dizziness and somnolence. In the U.S., Lyrica(R) (pregabalin) capsules C-V is FDA approved for the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures. Developed by Pfizer, Lyrica is an alpha-2-delta ligand that is believed to work by calming hyper-excited neurons.

120,Pfizer1,"Pfizer Receives FDA Approval for Exubera, the First Inhalable Form of Insulin for Controlling Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes in Adults; CEO McKinnell: 'Exubera is a Major, First-of-its-Kind, Medical Breakthrough That Marks Another Critical Step Forward in the Treatment of Diabetes, a Disease that Has Taken an Enormous Human and Economic Toll Worldwide'; Innovative Hand-Held Insulin Device Effectively Controls Diabetes and Provides Reliable and Easy to Use Insulin Dosing; Patient with Type 2 Diabetes: 'With Exubera, I've Been Able to Control my Blood Sugar Levels and Not Constantly Worry About How I Manage My Diabetes.'; Diabetes is the Fifth Leading Cause of Death in the U.S. and Accounts for $132 Billion in Annual Healthcare Costs",,"1,189 words",27 January 2006,04:35 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that Exubera(R) (insulin human [rDNA origin]) Inhalation Powder has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Exubera was found in clinical trials to be as effective as short-acting insulin injections, and to significantly improve blood sugar control when added to diabetes pills. Exubera, which is expected to be available for patients by mid-year, is the first inhaled form of insulin and the first insulin option that does not need to be administered by injection in the United States.","""Exubera is a major, first-of-its-kind, medical breakthrough that marks another critical step forward in the treatment of diabetes, a disease that has taken an enormous human and economic toll worldwide,"" said Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. ""The global incidence of diabetes is currently at epidemic levels. Millions of patients are not achieving or maintaining acceptable blood sugar levels, despite the availability of current therapies. Exubera meets a critical medical need by offering a highly effective and needle-free alternative to diabetes pills and insulin injections to manage this complicated, debilitating disease.""

Exubera is a rapid-acting, dry powder human insulin that is inhaled through the mouth into the lungs prior to eating, using the handheld Exubera Inhaler. The Exubera inhaler weighs four ounces and, when closed, is about the size of an eyeglass case. The unique Exubera Inhaler produces in its chamber a cloud of insulin powder, which is designed to pass rapidly into the bloodstream to regulate the body's blood sugar levels.

Exubera Meets Medical Need

""Many people who could benefit from insulin are fearful of injections, so they delay treatment five years or ten years, placing them at risk for serious complications. Now, for the first time patients can improve blood sugar control with fewer or no painful injections,"" said Dr. William Cefalu, Exubera investigator and chief of the division of nutrition and chronic diseases at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, a campus of the Louisiana State University System, in Baton Rouge.

The efficacy and safety profile of Exubera was studied in more than 2,500 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes for an average duration of 20 months. In clinical trials, many patients using Exubera reported greater treatment satisfaction than patients taking insulin by injection. Significantly more patients who had used both Exubera and insulin injections or diabetes pills reported an overall preference for Exubera.

""With Exubera, I've been able to control my blood sugar levels and not constantly worry about how I manage my diabetes,"" said Jamie Villastrigo, a type 2 diabetes patient and Exubera clinical trial participant.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, Exubera can be used alone as an alternative to rapid-acting insulin injections or diabetes pills, or in combination with diabetes pills or longer-acting insulin. In patients with type 1 diabetes, Exubera will be used in combination with longer-acting insulin.

The Burden of Diabetes in the United States

Complications commonly associated with uncontrolled or poorly controlled blood sugar levels include heart disease, amputation, blindness and kidney failure. Diabetes and its complications are estimated to account for $132 billion in direct and indirect health care costs annually.

Nearly 21 million Americans have diabetes and approximately 95 percent of these people have type 2 diabetes.

In type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well enough to manage blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes progresses over time, and eventually most patients will need to administer insulin to achieve blood sugar control. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin at all. These patients must take insulin to survive.

All people with type 1 diabetes and a large percentage of people with type 2 diabetes need treatment with insulin. While insulin has been proven to be effective to reduce blood sugar levels and the risk of complications, health care providers and patients often have been unwilling to start treatment. Factors include patients' fear of injections and social embarrassment associated with needles.

Exubera is the result of one of the most rigorous and innovative diabetes development programs. Pfizer has invested in two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities -- the world's largest insulin plants in Frankfurt, Germany, and a highly automated, high-tech production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.

Exubera is a product of a collaboration between Pfizer and Nektar Therapeutics. Pfizer recently reached an agreement to acquire the sanofi- aventis worldwide rights to Exubera. The two companies were previously in a worldwide alliance to co-develop, co-promote and co-manufacture Exubera.

Important Safety Information about Exubera

Patients should not take Exubera if they smoke or have stopped smoking less than six months prior to starting Exubera treatment. If a patient starts smoking or resumes smoking, he or she must stop using Exubera and see a health care provider about a different treatment.

Exubera may affect lung function so patients need to have their lungs tested before starting Exubera, and periodically thereafter, as directed by a healthcare provider. The test involves exhaling into a measuring device. Exubera is not recommended for people that have chronic lung disease (such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema). Also, Exubera should not be used at all by people with unstable or poorly controlled lung disease.

Like all medicines, Exubera can cause side effects. As with all forms of insulin, a possible side effect of Exubera is low blood sugar levels. Some patients have reported a mild cough while taking Exubera, which occurred within seconds to minutes after Exubera inhalation. Coughing occurred less frequently as patients continued to use Exubera.

Patients and health care providers can call 1-800-EXUBERA and register to receive more information about Exubera when it is available. The hotline can be accessed in English.

128,Pfizer1,"European Commission Approves Macugen for Treatment of All Types of Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration; First Treatment to Target Underlying Disease Process of Wet AMD; ""Each year there are an estimated 500,000 new cases of Wet AMD worldwide, so new treatment options are crucially important""",,810 words,2 February 2006,12:14 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Feb. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization for Macugen(R) (pegaptanib sodium injection) for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age- related macular degeneration (AMD), an age-related eye disease that destroys central vision critical to reading, driving and color vision.

Macugen is the first treatment to target the underlying disease process and has been proven to help preserve visual acuity in patients with wet AMD. Clinical studies showed that Macugen prevented severe vision loss at twice the rate of standard care, which included photodynamic therapy.","""Macugen represents an important treatment advance for this leading cause of irreversible vision loss,"" said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer. ""Macugen is the first therapy indicated in Europe for the treatment of all types of wet AMD, regardless of lesion subtype, size or visual acuity. Pfizer is committed to bringing innovative medicines to patients facing the loss of vision caused by wet AMD, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and other diseases of the eye.""

Wet AMD is a chronic, progressive disease of the macula, the central portion of the retina responsible for sight that allows people to see faces, walk stairs and engage in daily activities. Central vision is impaired when abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the macula, known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), causes bleeding and other fluid accumulation in the retina.

""While the problem of wet AMD is a global one, it hits particularly hard in areas with rapidly aging populations, such as Europe,"" said Steve Winyard, chairman of the AMD Alliance International. ""Each year there are an estimated 500,000 new cases of wet AMD worldwide, so new treatment options are crucially important.""

About Macugen

Macugen is indicated for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.

Macugen is the first of a new type of ophthalmic drug that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF 165), a protein that acts as a signal in triggering CNV, the single disease process underlying all subtypes of wet AMD. By selectively binding to VEGF 165, Macugen reduces blood vessel growth and leakage, thereby limiting the progression of vision loss and helping patients preserve the vision they have.

The approval was based on the results of two pivotal clinical trials involving 1,186 patients with all subtypes of wet AMD. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients protected from a three-line loss of visual acuity on the eye chart by week 54. Seventy percent of patients who had 0.3 mg of Macugen every six weeks lost fewer than three lines of vision on the eye chart, compared with 55 percent of patients in the control group -- a 27 percent treatment benefit. After one year, patients were randomized to continue or discontinue treatment for another year. Two-year clinical data from the studies demonstrated a continued treatment benefit with Macugen and that treatment should be initiated as early as possible.

Overall, Macugen was well tolerated. Patients on Macugen for two years received over 90 percent of possible injections, indicating strong compliance and acceptance to therapy. Most of the adverse events reported over the two years were mild in severity, transient and attributed by investigators to the injection procedure rather than the study drug.

Macugen is contraindicated in patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infection or with known hypersensitivity to the active or inactive substances.

Rare post-marketing cases of an allergic reaction have been reported in patients within several hours after injection with Macugen, although a direct relationship to Macugen or other factors has not been established.

The safety and efficacy of Macugen beyond two years have not been demonstrated.

Macugen has been approved by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Pakistan and the Philippines, with filings submitted in 15 other countries. More than 50,000 patients with wet AMD have been treated with Macugen in the United States last year. Macugen is an important addition to a Pfizer ophthalmology portfolio that includes market-leading glaucoma medications Xalatan/Xalacom.

Pfizer has an exclusive license from OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to develop and market Macugen outside of the United States. Pfizer and OSI jointly develop and market Macugen in the United States.

137,Pfizer1,"New Peer-To-Peer, Diabetes Self-Management Program to Address Health Disparities in Underserved Populations; Pfizer Health Solutions and Community HealthCare Center, an Alliance of Volunteers in Medicine, Collaborate to Offer a Culturally Relevant Health Education Program to People with Diabetes",,910 words,7 February 2006,12:16 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"SAVANNAH, Ga., Feb. 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Pfizer Health Solutions Inc (PHS) and Community Healthcare Center (CHC) have officially launched a culturally appropriate diabetes education program to help reduce health disparities for people with diabetes among Savannah's Hispanic and African American communities. The Amigos En Salud(TM) (""Friends in Health"") program is based on a community health worker (CHW) model which educates, empowers and motivates people with diabetes to help them better manage their disease, which in turn leads to improved health and lower health care costs in local communities.","CHC is a member of the Volunteers in Medicine (VIM) Alliance of Free Clinics that provides free primary health care to the medically uninsured and underinsured. In Georgia, where VIM has helped establish four other clinics in Brunswick, Jasper, Macon and Warner Robins, 15 percent of those with a household income of less than $15,000 have diabetes, more than twice the state average of 6.8 percent.(i) Local CHWs have been trained to offer group and individual health education to people with diabetes and their family members so they can learn new techniques to better manage their health. Diabetes is often accompanied by other serious health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and depression, and requires individuals to make changes in their lifestyle, such as eating healthy, being more physically active, and consistently monitoring their blood sugar.

""The Amigos en Salud program will give Savannah's underserved population with diabetes the education and tools to help them take control of their own health,"" said Julia Portale, director of community health, PHS. ""Amigos en Salud provides access to local community health workers and resources that complement each person's culture and individual lifestyles.""

Amigos en Salud is now available to eligible individuals with diabetes in Chatham County. The program is designed to help participants achieve clinical and behavioral health outcomes that mirror the American Diabetes Association standards of care, including glycemic control and lifestyle modification related to healthy eating and regular physical activity.

""The trained community health workers will support CHC health care professionals by providing follow-up and social support to patients, helping them overcome cultural, language or behavioral barriers to treatment,"" said Miriam Rittmeyer, M.D., Executive Director of CHC. ""We believe this community- based approach will improve the health of the people we serve in Savannah and is a promising approach to improve care and reduce health care costs by helping prevent serious complications of diabetes.""

About Amigos en Salud

Amigos en Salud, which translates to ""Friends in Health,"" is a culturally appropriate diabetes self-management program that addresses cultural perceptions and lifestyles. The Amigos en Salud program is designed to help patients with diabetes understand their condition, encourage and sustain behavior change, support development of self-management skills, and provide ongoing community support -- in the context of individual cultures.

The program uses trained community health workers, working collaboratively with health care practitioners, to provide individual and group health education sessions to support patients with diabetes. The CHWs also work directly with patients and family members to develop and implement culturally relevant behavior change strategies, using bilingual education materials at the appropriate literacy level, as necessary.

Since 2002, the Amigos program, developed by Pfizer Health Solutions, has been implemented in multiple communities throughout the United States: Laredo and Brownsville, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Hartford, Connecticut; and Jersey City, New Jersey. In these pilot programs, the patients who participated showed improvement in the American Diabetes Association's goal of lowered HbA1c and LDL cholesterol and exhibited improved adherence to diabetes process measures, including nutrition counseling, eye exams, foot exams, physician visits, and obtaining HbA1c tests. Behavioral changes, like eating healthy and exercising, also significantly improved.

About Community HealthCare Center / Volunteers in Medicine

Community HealthCare Center provides access to primary health care in a dignified and compassionate way to people between the ages of 18 and 64 years who live or work in Chatham County and meet certain financial criteria.

The Community HealthCare Center is modeled on the nationally successful Volunteers in Medicine (VIM) movement in which local communities develop free health care clinics staffed primarily by retired medical professionals willing to volunteer their services to care for the uninsured. The number of retirees willing to volunteer is expected to grow exponentially as the baby boomers come into retirement.

141,Pfizer1,Pfizer Petitions FDA to Recall Teva and Sandoz Generic Azithromycin Products to Correct Misbranding; --- Pfizer Charges Teva and Sandoz With Patent Infringement,,419 words,8 February 2006,05:06 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Feb. 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that it has filed a Citizen Petition alerting the FDA that generic azithromycin products sold by Teva Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. and Sandoz Inc. appear to be misbranded because their labels do not accurately describe the drugs' active ingredients.

Pfizer also has brought patent infringement actions against the two companies claiming that these products violate a recently-issued Pfizer patent. The Teva and Sandoz drugs are generic versions of Pfizer's antibiotic, Zithromax(R).","Pfizer's petition asks the FDA to initiate a recall of the Teva and Sandoz medicines to correct their misbranding. Pfizer also asks the agency to review the product approval applications filed by the two companies to ensure the information contained within them is accurate and complete and, if not, to take appropriate remedial action.

""Patients and physicians must be able to trust that the medicine in the bottle is the same as that which is described in the label,"" said Hank McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ""Pfizer wants to ensure that patients do not receive generic products that fail to meet FDA standards.""

In its patent infringement actions, Pfizer is claiming that the Teva and Sandoz products violate a recently-issued Pfizer patent covering azithromycin sesquihydrate. Pfizer is requesting that the court impose preliminary and permanent injunctions against further sales of the drugs.

Pfizer alleges that the drugs contain significant amounts of azithromycin sesquihydrate rather than the azithromycin monohydrate that they claim in their labels. Both Pfizer's Zithromax(R) and a generic azithromycin launched by the company's Greenstone subsidiary contain azithromycin dihydrate, which is the product approved in Pfizer's NDA. Zithromax's composition-of-matter patent in the U.S. expired in November 2005.

Teva and Sandoz each launched their generic products in November, 2005. In response to those launches, Greenstone introduced its generic azithromycin in the same month. Pfizer will continue to market its generic azithromycin through Greenstone.

NEW YORK, Feb. 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc is executing a wide-ranging strategy to transform all areas of its business, grow current and new medicines, drive productivity improvements and launch innovative patient-centered healthcare initiatives.

Addressing financial analysts here today, Pfizer outlined its drivers of value for 2006-2008, including growth of its key in-line medicines, an increasingly substantial contribution from new medicines, enhanced R&D productivity supporting a broad and promising pipeline of new medicines, and streamlining to reduce costs and speed decision-making in all parts of the company.

""This is a time of transformation for Pfizer and our industry,"" said Hank McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ""We are responding directly to the realities of our operating environment as we build value today while aggressively investing in the future. We have many significant opportunities ahead of us.

""We are rapidly adapting our business to effectively balance the demands of our customers, the needs of patients, and the interests of shareholders. Over the next three years, a new generation Pfizer will emerge, and our company will have the operating and financial strength to sustain value.""

Key Elements of Financial Forecast and Strategy to Build Shareholder Value

""Pfizer is aggressively transforming itself in all aspects of its business -- challenging the old ways and taking risks with new directions and innovations -- in sales, marketing, R&D, and manufacturing,"" said Vice Chairman David Shedlarz. ""While near-term results will be tempered by loss of exclusivity of older medicines, we see a bright, long-term future driven by growth of current and new medicines, productivity enhancements and new initiatives to enhance shareholder value.""

Revenue Growth. Pfizer expects sustained growth from key medicines and an increasingly large contribution from new medicines, which will offset the impact of loss of exclusivity. The company is reallocating resources to ensure the highest growth from its portfolio of important medicines.

Productivity Enhancements. The Adapting to Scale initiative will continue to produce substantial cost savings while creating a more efficient company. Adapting to Scale spans all functions, processes and geographies, with specific programs focused on enhancing R&D productivity, optimizing the field force, consolidating our network of manufacturing plants and optimizing the procurement of goods and services.

Initiatives to Enhance Shareholder Value. Pfizer will continue to use its strong cash flow from operations to enhance shareholder value. The company is focused on three important initiatives to leverage cash flow: increasing our dividend payout and yield, purchasing shares, and changing Pfizer's business portfolio, including the recently announced decision to explore strategic alternatives for Pfizer Consumer Healthcare (PCH).

Financial Guidance. Mr. Shedlarz said the financial impact of these and other transformational efforts are expected to result in the following guidance for 2006 performance:

  -- 2006 Revenues comparable to 2005, as growth of current and new products
     offsets revenue declines from loss of exclusivity and adverse foreign
     exchange
  -- 2006 Reported Diluted EPS of $1.52 to $1.56
  -- 2006 Adjusted Diluted EPS* comparable to 2005 at about $2.00, including
     the adverse impact of stock-option expensing and foreign exchange
  -- Mid-single-digit Adjusted Diluted EPS* growth in 2006, without the
     adverse impact of stock-option expensing and foreign exchange
  -- Modest improvement in 2006 of Adjusted Gross Margins** versus 2005
  -- Cost savings from the Adapting to Scale productivity initiative of
     about $2 billion in 2006
  -- 2006 operating cash flow of more than $16 billion
  -- 26 percent growth in the first-quarter 2006 dividend
  -- At least $1 billion in 2006 share purchases



Regarding performance in 2007 and 2008, Mr. Shedlarz provided the following guidance:

  -- Revenue growth is expected to resume in 2007, as contributions from new
     medicines and sustained in-line medicine growth more than offset the
     declining impact of loss of exclusivity
  -- Cost savings from the Adapting to Scale initiative of about $3.5
     billion by 2007 and of about $4 billion by 2008
  -- High-single-digit average annual growth in Adjusted Diluted EPS* over
     the two-year period of 2007-2008
  -- Continued strong growth in cash flow from operations anticipated to
     more than $19 billion by 2008



Earlier this week, Pfizer said it would explore strategic alternatives for its consumer healthcare business. ""This is the right time to undertake this review, given the premium the marketplace is placing on similar large, high-quality consumer businesses,"" Mr. Shedlarz said. ""We expect to make this decision in the third quarter of 2006.""

Pfizer Consumer Healthcare has a well-balanced product portfolio anchored by key brands including Listerine, Benadryl and Visine, and broad geographic presence. The business has maintained a strong, consistent financial performance, with high margins and stable cash flows. The business had 2005 segment revenues of $3.9 billion and pre-tax segment income of about $700 million. The median multiple of stock-price-to-2005 earnings for consumer healthcare companies is 21. If this multiple were applied to PCH, it could be valued as a stand-alone business at more than $10 billion.

     Pfizer Expects Strong Growth of Current and Emerging Medicines;
            New Growth to Offset Impact of Patent Expirations



Karen Katen, vice chairman and president of Pfizer Human Health, said, ""We are expecting strong growth for Lipitor, Celebrex and Lyrica in 2006, and we see excellent prospects for a number of new medicines we plan to launch this year. These include recently approved Sutent and Exubera, breakthrough treatments for cancer and diabetes, respectively, as well as our smoking cessation medicine Champix, which is currently under priority review by the FDA.""

Ms. Katen said the company expects sales of Lipitor, the world's most-prescribed medicine, to exceed $13 billion in 2006. ""We continue to enhance the Lipitor label -- including a new indication for reducing strokes -- and differentiate Lipitor with high-impact economic data demonstrating its benefits. In addition, Lipitor is performing well against generic simvastatin in many markets where the two medicines compete. This shows our efforts to communicate Lipitor's tremendous value in reducing cardiovascular events are effective. Given the large numbers of untreated patients, Lipitor has excellent opportunities to grow even further,"" Ms. Katen said.

""Going forward, we are going to highlight the benefits of Lipitor with new economic data demonstrating that Lipitor prevents costly cardiovascular events and associated healthcare costs while providing better overall cardiovascular health to patients,"" Ms. Katen said.

The company anticipates that sales of Celebrex will increase to more than $2 billion in 2006 and that sales of Lyrica will triple to more than $900 million. ""Celebrex is showing strong signs of growth with new prescription trends in the U.S. climbing steadily since October,"" Ms. Katen said. ""In the fourth quarter of 2005, we saw an increase of 8 percent in new Celebrex prescriptions while those for branded NSAIDs fell nearly 3 percent.""

Celebrex offers clear gastrointestinal (GI) advantages. ""Epidemiological data indicate that Celebrex has lower rates of GI bleeding requiring hospitalization than other highly prescribed pain relievers like naproxen and ibuprofen,"" Ms. Katen said. ""This GI profile also was confirmed in recent study results published in the British Medical Journal.""

To further characterize Celebrex's cardiovascular profile, Pfizer is funding the first large-scale safety study of Celebrex and traditional NSAIDs in patients with heart disease or those at high risk for heart disease. The Pfizer-funded study is being run independently by the Cleveland Clinic and will involve 20,000 patients worldwide.

Lyrica sales are outpacing those of other medicines that treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain. ""Physicians are prescribing Lyrica because of the positive experiences their patients are having,"" Ms. Katen said. ""In one survey, 70 percent of doctors cited rapid pain relief as an attribute they associate with Lyrica."" Pfizer is aggressively pursuing additional indications including generalized anxiety disorder, fibromyalgia and other neuropathic pain conditions.

Ms. Katen said Pfizer expects strong long-term performance for a number of new medicines, in many cases exceeding the expectations of financial analysts. Key product highlights include:

  -- Exubera, one of the most important innovations in diabetes treatment
     since the discovery of insulin in the 1920s.  Pfizer anticipates
     exceptional uptake for this fast-acting inhaled form of insulin due to
     better control of blood sugar without injections.
  -- Sutent, a novel treatment for two difficult-to-treat cancers.  Sutent
     offers new hope to patients who otherwise have no options.  Because of
     Sutent's unique mechanism of action, it has potential to treat other
     more common malignancies, and Pfizer is aggressively pursuing
     additional indications.
  -- Champix, Pfizer's smoking cessation medicine currently under FDA
     priority review, is expected to be a major advance in improving health
     worldwide.  Discovered and developed by Pfizer, Champix has
     demonstrated radically improved quit rates compared to other leading
     smoking cessation products.  Champix is unique in that it diminishes
     cravings while also decreasing the reward smokers get from cigarettes.



In addition, Pfizer expects to launch indiplon for insomnia, the antifungal medicine Eraxis, and Zeven, an antibiotic.

Pfizer has realigned its U.S. business in response to the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. In 2006, Pfizer estimates that Medicare Part D sales will represent about 20 percent of total U.S. sales, expanding to double that by 2008. Ms. Katen said Pfizer is well positioned in the Medicare marketplace with the majority of the company's key medicines represented on formularies.

""In addition, we restructured our U.S. field force to mirror the new regional structure under Medicare,"" Ms. Katen said. ""This has resulted in our representatives spending more time in the field with less duplication, enabling us to build even stronger relationships with physicians and Medicare prescription drug plans.""

Ms. Katen also said Pfizer is competing effectively in the generic market in the U.S. through the company's Greenstone subsidiary, which offers high-quality generic medicines to U.S. consumers.

""We are mindful that, with increasing life expectancy and a growing number of new medical innovations, the demand for healthcare will only increase,"" Ms. Katen said. ""At the same time, budgets will be further constrained, putting even greater pressure on the healthcare system. Through a series of initiatives, Pfizer is investing in prevention and wellness and helping patients proactively manage chronic diseases, which ultimately will better control total healthcare costs.""

Productivity Improvements Drive Pipeline Expansion

Dr. John LaMattina, president of Pfizer Global Research and Development, highlighted the company's progress in three areas: enhancing R&D productivity, advancing the company's pipeline of new medicines and expanding the scope of Pfizer R&D.

Dr. LaMattina said Pfizer is achieving productivity improvements through a focus on the quality and quantity of new medicine candidates. ""Our dual focus on improving both candidate output and candidate quality is setting the foundation for sustained R&D productivity in the years to come,"" he said. With these enhancements, Pfizer's objective is to ultimately deliver four medicines per year from the company's internal research efforts.

Pfizer's pipeline continues to grow and now consists of 235 total projects, including 152 novel compounds and 83 product enhancements. ""We have successfully streamlined and restructured our organization. Our pipeline is now 8 percent larger than at the end of 2004,"" Dr. LaMattina said.

Pfizer has completed 17 filings for approval of new medicines since 2001, 11 of which are approved and on the market. Dr. LaMattina added that the company expects two additional filings in 2006 -- one for maraviroc, a CCR-5 antagonist in Phase III studies for treatment of HIV/AIDS, and one through a licensing opportunity the company expects to announce in the first half of the year.

Dr. LaMattina said Pfizer is targeting three additional NDA filings in 2007, including torcetrapib/atorvastatin for cholesterol management, the schizophrenia medicine asenapine and ticilimumab, a new therapy for serious and life-threatening cancers.

In describing the expanding scope of Pfizer's R&D activities, Dr. LaMattina said the company has established a firm foothold in biologics with medicines including Genotropin and Macugen, among others. Sales of biologics in 2006 are expected to total $1.5 billion; Pfizer expects to triple revenues from biologics by 2010, placing the company among the top five producers of biologics. ""From a single program in 1996, our presence in biologics has grown to encompass more than 36 programs today, and we have a truly enviable pipeline of new medicines in this important area,"" Dr. LaMattina said.

           Pfizer Committed to Vigorous Global Defense Against
      Patent Infringement, Counterfeiting and Foreign Price Controls



Pfizer Vice Chairman and General Counsel Jeffrey Kindler reviewed the progress the company is making on the policy, legal and legislative fronts to effectively meet challenges in the company's operating environment, including threats to its intellectual property.

Regarding intellectual property, Mr. Kindler said, ""We will continue to aggressively defend our medicines from patent challenges and discourage unwarranted attacks on innovators. Many of these attacks are on our basic patents, and we have a 'zero-tolerance' policy for out-and-out patent infringement."" Mr. Kindler cited Pfizer's recent high-profile victories, most notably its defense of Lipitor in the U.S., U.K. and Spain. ""We have established an excellent track record in these cases that has validated our strategy for defending the patents protecting this critical medicine,"" he said.

Mr. Kindler also said Pfizer is combating the global threat of counterfeiting on multiple fronts, including focusing more resources on anti- counterfeiting investigations and working cooperatively with government and law enforcement agencies around the world to address the problem.

In the policy area, Mr. Kindler noted that Pfizer is addressing foreign price controls and access restrictions as a top priority. ""We are enlisting a broad array of allies, including the U.S. government, to advance policies supporting healthcare innovation around the world. With so much of the research-based pharmaceutical industry located in the U.S., we believe that this will become an even greater priority for keeping America at the forefront of health and economic prosperity.

""As the U.S. Department of Commerce has recognized, not only do foreign price controls and access restrictions harm patients in those countries, they also force American patients to bear a disproportionate share of the cost of research and development for new treatments,"" he said.

Conclusion. In summary, Hank McKinnell said, ""Pfizer is changing, our industry is changing, and healthcare systems around the world are changing. We believe that future healthcare will be rooted in prevention and wellness and early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases. All of these approaches play to Pfizer's strengths. With our highly talented workforce, Pfizer can be a catalyst in this evolution toward integrated, affordable and patient-centered healthcare.""

162,Pfizer1,"Pfizer Receives FDA Approval for Eraxis(TM) to Treat Candidemia, a Potentially Life-Threatening Bloodstream Infection; People with Weakened Immune Systems and Critically Ill Patients are Among Those at High Risk for Candidemia Infection; Eraxis Builds on Pfizer's Strength in Antifungal Medicines",,959 words,21 February 2006,10:44 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Feb. 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that Eraxis(TM) (anidulafungin) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat candidemia, a potentially life-threatening bloodstream infection. Candidemia is the most deadly of the common hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, with a mortality rate of approximately 40 percent.

In the United States, candidemia affects approximately one in 5,000 people, resulting in an estimated 60,000 cases each year. ""Bloodstream infections such as candidemia can spread quickly and are very dangerous, especially for patients with weakened immune systems,"" said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer. ""Physicians treating these seriously ill patients now have an important new treatment in Eraxis.""","Patients at high risk for candidemia and systemic candidiasis (Candida infection that spreads throughout the body) include those with compromised immune systems, stem-cell and organ-transplant recipients, patients on chemotherapy, patients with catheters, critically ill patients in intensive care units, surgical patients and patients on prolonged antibiotic therapy. In the U.S., patients with candidemia on average spend an additional 10 days in the hospital at an average increase in hospital charges of about $39,000 per patient.

""In the clinical trial setting, patients taking Eraxis for the treatment of candidemia had improved efficacy versus those taking fluconazole, making Eraxis an important addition to the options in antifungal treatment,"" said Dr. Annette Reboli, head of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, New Jersey, and lead clinical investigator. ""In addition, Eraxis has been shown to have a safety profile comparable to fluconazole and to be compatible with many medicines commonly used by patients with candidemia who have other serious health complications.""

Eraxis, an antifungal medicine of the echinocandin class, also was approved by the FDA to treat two additional infections caused by the Candida fungus-peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscesses -- as well as esophageal candidiasis, a fungal infection of the esophagus.

Eraxis builds upon Pfizer's extraordinary strength in medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases, particularly antifungal treatments. Pfizer's Diflucan(R) (fluconazole) has been the longstanding gold standard treatment for candidemia and other fungal infections, especially opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients. Pfizer's Vfend(R) (voriconazole), also a product of innovative Pfizer research, is a treatment for serious mold and yeast infections. Both Diflucan and Vfend are azole-type antifungal treatments.

Eraxis is the only medicine that has demonstrated improved efficacy versus fluconazole in a pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of candidemia. Eraxis was added to the company's antifungal portfolio through the acquisition of Vicuron in September 2005.

About Candida Infections

Candidemia is a systemic fungal infection that occurs when Candida organisms are present in the blood. The bloodstream may then spread Candida to organs and tissues throughout the body, causing systemic candidiasis.

Systemic candidiasis is difficult to diagnose and can cause organ failure, which may result in death. It can infect organs such as the kidneys, liver, bones, muscles, joints, spleen, or eyes.

Esophageal candidiasis is a fungal infection of the esophagus that is most common among people with compromised immune systems such as people with HIV/AIDS.

About Eraxis

Eraxis is an antifungal agent indicated for the treatment of candidemia and two other Candida infections, peritonitis (infection of the abdominal cavity) and intra-abdominal abscesses. Eraxis has not been studied in endocarditis, osteomyclitis, and meningitis due to Candida, and has not been studied in sufficient numbers of neutropenic patients (those with low white blood cell counts) to determine efficacy in this group. It was also approved for esophageal candidiasis, an infection of the esophagus caused by Candida (relapse rates post-therapy were higher for patients on Eraxis).

Important Safety Information

In clinical studies, Eraxis was as well tolerated as fluconazole and the total number of drug-related adverse events was comparable to fluconazole. The most common treatment-related adverse events for Eraxis in the candidemia study included lower than normal levels of potassium in the blood (3.1%), diarrhea (3.1%), and an increase in ALT (a liver enzyme) (2.3%). In the esophageal candidiasis study, the most common treatment-related adverse events for Eraxis were headache (1.3%) and an increase of GGT (a liver enzyme) (1.3%).

Eraxis has not been associated with renal toxicity, and has no clinically relevant drug-to-drug interactions. Eraxis also does not require dose adjustments based on gender, race, age, HIV status, hepatic insufficiency or renal insufficiency. (Safety and effectiveness of Eraxis in pediatric patients has not been established.)

Eraxis is not approved for use in patients with hypersensitivity to anidulafungin, any component of Eraxis, or other echinocandin agents. In some patients with serious underlying medical conditions who were receiving multiple concomitant medications along with Eraxis, clinically significant hepatic abnormalities have occurred. Possible histamine-mediated symptoms have been reported infrequently with Eraxis, including rash, urticaria, flushing, pruritis, dyspnea, and hypotension.

180,Pfizer1,Pfizer Completes Acquisition of Worldwide Rights to Exubera From sanofi-aventis; First Inhalable Form of Insulin for the Treatment of Adults with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes,,370 words,1 March 2006,10:23 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, March 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that it has acquired the sanofi-aventis worldwide rights to Exubera (inhaled human insulin). Pfizer received approval last month to market Exubera in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Exubera is the first inhalable form of insulin to be approved since the discovery of insulin in the 1920s, and represents a major advance in diabetes treatment.","Diabetes is a leading cause of death by disease worldwide and is currently at epidemic proportions. If blood sugar levels are not controlled, serious complications including heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and nerve damage will often develop. Approximately 194 million people worldwide have the disease.

Exubera is a rapid-acting, dry powder human insulin that is inhaled through the mouth into the lungs prior to eating, using a portable, handheld inhaler that when closed is about the size of an eyeglass case. Exubera is the result of one of the most rigorous and innovative diabetes development programs ever conducted.

In clinical trials, many patients using Exubera reported greater treatment satisfaction than patients taking insulin by injection. Even those patients who had used both Exubera and insulin injections or diabetes pills reported an overall preference for Exubera.

Pfizer and sanofi-aventis were previously in a worldwide alliance to co-develop, co-promote and co-manufacture Exubera. Pfizer has also acquired the sanofi-aventis rights to the Exubera insulin production facilities located in Frankfurt, Germany, which were previously jointly owned by Pfizer and sanofi-aventis. Exubera is currently a product of collaboration between Pfizer and Nektar Therapeutics.

190,Pfizer1,"'Only Lipitor Has Demonstrated Significant LDL Reductions and Cardiovascular Benefits for a Wide Range of Patients, With an Excellent Efficacy and Safety Profile Across the Full Dose Range'; Lipitor demonstrated plaque regression in REVERSAL trial",,425 words,13 March 2006,01:00 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"ATLANTA, March 13 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- In response to inquiries from the news media about the ASTEROID trial for Crestor presented today at the American College of Cardiology, Pfizer issued the following statement:","-- Only Lipitor has demonstrated significant LDL reductions and
     cardiovascular benefits for a wide range of patients, with an excellent
     efficacy and safety profile across the full dose range.

  -- This is not the first time a statin has demonstrated plaque regression.
     The REVERSAL trial compared treatment with Lipitor 80mg to another
     lipid lowering agent over 18 months.  In a subset of high-plaque burden
     patients, Lipitor demonstrated a 5.9% (P<.001) total plaque reduction
     with excellent toleration.

  -- It is not possible to compare the findings from ASTEROID with REVERSAL
     given ASTEROID's open label, single-arm design did not include a
     comparator.  In contrast, Lipitor has demonstrated significant LDL and
     cardiovascular benefits in well controlled clinical trials such as
     PROVE IT, TNT and IDEAL.

  -- Treatment practice has evolved significantly in the past several years,
     strongly supported by the results of the Lipitor clinical outcomes
     trials.  Studies like PROVE IT, TNT and IDEAL have conclusively
     demonstrated the benefit of intensive lipid lowering with Lipitor.

  -- The LDL levels reached in these studies, ranging from 60 to 80 mg/dL,
     are attainable only through intensive lipid lowering to a degree that
     cannot be matched with older, less efficacious therapies such as
     simvastatin.

  -- Lipitor has a proven record of safety and over 115 million patient
     years of experience that cannot be matched by any other medicine.

  -- Pfizer is using the IVUS technology in its large-scale Phase III
     torcetrapib/atorvastatin clinical trials program, which is studying
     some 25,000 patients at hundreds of medical centers worldwide.

  -- The results from these trials, which will report out in the near
     future, will provide additional information on the lipid hypotheses
     alluded to in ASTEROID in a well-controlled manner.

193,Pfizer1,New Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin Research Further Supports Raising 'Good' HDL Cholesterol,,"1,560 words",14 March 2006,09:11 AM,PR Newswire Europe,TWOTEN,,,English,Copyright ? 2006 PR Newswire Europe Limited.  All Rights Reserved.,"ATLANTA, March 14 /PRNewswire/ --


    -- Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin Clinical Trial Program is the Largest Ever
       Conducted by Pfizer: 25,000 Patients Enrolled in Studies Underway
       Around the World
    -- Pfizer Clinician: ""First Data to Show that there are Important
       Differences in Raising HDL Cholesterol Levels with Torcetrapib and
       Atorvastatin Depending on Whether it is Dosed in the Morning or
       Evening""
    -- TNT Trial Investigator: ""The TNT Sub-Analysis Suggests that HDL
       Cholesterol May Also Provide Important Therapeutic Benefits that May
       Result in Further Reductions in Cardiovascular Risk""","Pfizer said today that new data, involving its medicine in development torcetrapib/atorvastatin, provides important information on the benefit of raising HDL, or ""good"" cholesterol, while simultaneously lowering LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. These new findings may play a critical role in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease and potentially improving quality of life for patients. Data from three separate studies were presented this week at the American College of Cardiology meeting.

""As the first potential treatment to offer substantial HDL cholesterol elevations and significant LDL cholesterol lowering, torcetrapib/atorvastatin could well change how physicians manage their patients with cardiovascular disease,"" said Dr. John LaMattina, president of Pfizer Global Research and Development. ""This comprehensive clinical trial program will help determine if this hypothesis can offer patients the benefit of slowing atherosclerosis and ultimately preventing cardiovascular events beyond what can be achieved with Lipitor alone.""

It is estimated that 71 million Americans suffer from cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death in the United States. Most people with elevated cholesterol, a leading risk factor for heart attacks and strokes, are either not diagnosed or have not reached their target LDL levels with medication. In addition, research has shown that raising HDL-cholesterol may provide further benefits in the management of cardiovascular disease, which may have the potential to further reduce cardiovascular risk for patients.

Discovered and developed by Pfizer, torcetrapib works by blocking CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein) which is a protein that regulates cholesterol and is responsible for transferring cholesterol from its ""good"" HDL carrier to LDL, the ""bad"" carrier of cholesterol that results in plaque buildup in the arteries. Scientists believe that CETP inhibition raises HDL levels which results in cholesterol removal from the artery walls. Torcetrapib also lowers LDL cholesterol and LDL is known to cause heart attacks and stroke.

Presentation 1 - HDL and LDL as Predictors for CV Disease/Sub- Analysis of Lipitor TNT Study

The primary objective of the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study was to demonstrate the clinical benefits of intensive LDL cholesterol lowering. This sub-analysis of TNT found that patients treated to LDL cholesterol levels that were below current medical guidelines showed a direct relationship between HDL cholesterol levels and the frequency of cardiovascular events -- 1 mg/dL increase in HDL cholesterol levels was estimated to have an associated 2 percent reduction in the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

""This study further supports the potential benefits of managing HDL levels as an additional target for patients who are already receiving statin therapy,"" said Dr. Philip Barter, lead author, TNT sub-analysis, The Heart Institute in Sydney, Australia. ""While lowering LDL cholesterol remains a critical focus in cardiovascular disease prevention, the TNT sub-analysis suggests that HDL cholesterol may also provide important therapeutic benefits that may result in further reductions in cardiovascular risk.""

Presentation 2 - Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin: AM vs PM: Examining the Optimal Time of Dosing

Patients received either torcetrapib (100 mg) alone or torcetrapib (60 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) together, taken in the mornings or evenings, to determine if greater increases in HDL would be achieved based on the time of dosing. Torcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor is believed to be most effective when taken in the morning. Unlike most statins -- which are taken in the evening for maximum reduction in LDL cholesterol -- atorvastatin can be dosed anytime of the day and obtain equal LDL lowering effects.

Patients who took torcetrapib (60 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) in the morning experienced the most significant increase of 54.4 percent in HDL-cholesterol which was 12 percent higher than patients who took both torcetrapib and atorvastatin in the evening. Additionally, patients achieved a reduction in LDL cholesterol levels regardless of the time of day that therapy was taken.

""This is the first data to show that there are important differences in raising HDL cholesterol levels with torcetrapib depending on whether it is dosed in the morning or evening, and also highlights the flexibility and efficacy of atorvastatin,"" said Dr. Megan Gibbs, associate director of clinical research of Pfizer Global Research and Development.

Presentation 3 - Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin: Exploring Benefits of Lipid-Modifying Effects

Pfizer researchers also presented data from another study involving 493 patients to determine the effectiveness of torcetrapib (30, 60, 90 mg) either alone or in combination with atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, 80 mg).

In particular, the study addressed the HDL and LDL particle size and number using new technology -- nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Leading researchers believe both larger HDL and LDL particles, and lower numbers of LDL particles are less likely to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, or plaque build-up in the arteries, which is important in cardiovascular health. In this study, patients taking torcetrapib and atorvastatin together experienced a decrease in LDL cholesterol, and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels, as well as increases in the particle size of both HDL and LDL.

""These data provide important information on how CETP inhibition with torcetrapib affects the number and nature of lipid particles,"" said Dr. Tom Thuren, director of clinical development, Pfizer Global Research and Development. ""While the impact of these changes on cardiovascular risk is not currently known, we are diligently examining this and other areas in a large-scale clinical trial program.""

In this study, side effects of torcetrapib and Lipitor were similar to those most commonly associated with statin therapy. Patients taking 60 mg of torcetrapib with Lipitor also experienced an increase in systolic blood pressure of approximately 2 mm Hg, which will be further defined in ongoing phase 3 studies.

Pfizer's torcetrapib/atorvastatin development program is the largest and most comprehensive clinical trial program the company has ever undertaken and is studying some 25,000 patients at hundreds of medical centers worldwide at a cost of about US$800 million.

Lipitor Information

Lipitor is the most prescribed cholesterol-lowering therapy in the world, with nearly 107 million patient-years of experience.

It is used, in patients with multiple risk factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low HDL cholesterol or smoking, to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke and, along with a low-fat diet, to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is also used in patients with type 2 diabetes and one other risk factor such as high blood pressure, smoking, or other complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack.

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is not for women who are nursing, pregnant, or may become pregnant.

Patients who take Lipitor should tell their doctor about any unusual muscle pain or weakness. This could be a sign of serious muscle side effects. Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take. This may help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check patients' liver function before and during drug treatment, and may adjust the dose of Lipitor. Its most common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. They tend to be mild and often go away.

201,Pfizer2,"Lipitor's Safety Again Confirmed in Extensive Analysis of 49 Clinical Trials, Pfizer Says; Important and Timely Information for Physicians Intensively Treating Their Patients' Cholesterol; Patients Taking High Dose (80mg) Lipitor Reported Adverse Events Similar to Patients Taking Low Dose or Placebo",,937 words,17 January 2006,11:58 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 17 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Results of a recent analysis of 49 Lipitor clinical trials involving more than 14,000 patients showed that the overall rates of treatment-related adverse events reported by patients taking the highest dose of Lipitor were low and similar to those reported by patients who received placebo or the lowest dose of Lipitor. The analysis is published in the current edition of the American Journal of Cardiology.","""As more and more evidence has become available on the significant risks of high cholesterol, physicians are now being advised to aggressively lower their patients' cholesterol levels so that they get to their goal,"" said Dr. Gregg Larson, Pfizer vice president of U.S. cardiovascular medical. ""The cost of not getting to goal, both human and financial, can be very high. That's why this information is important and timely: it demonstrates to physicians that they can continue to feel confident in intensively treating their patients' cholesterol even with higher doses of Lipitor, as part of the drive to that all-important goal. As a result, patients get the benefit of even more reduction in their cardiovascular risk -- safely.""

The analysis, which included Lipitor clinical trials that were initiated and completed between 1992 and 2004, tracked the incidence of non-serious and serious muscle, liver and kidney adverse events and laboratory tests. The analysis compared 7,258 patients who received Lipitor 10mg to 4,798 patients taking Lipitor 80mg and 2,180 patients taking placebo. The average age of men and women in the analysis was 59 -- with the oldest patients over 90 years of age. The patients had varying degrees of cardiovascular risk.

  Results include:
  * Lipitor was well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events related
    to the digestive system.
  * There was no direct relationship observed between the dose of Lipitor
    and the frequency of muscle adverse events.
  * The incidence of myalgia (muscle weakness or pain) was low and similar
    in patients taking Lipitor 10mg and 80mg doses.
  * Myopathy (muscle weakness or pain combined with a 10-fold increase in
    muscle enzymes and more severe than myalgia) was rare and unlikely to be
    dose related in Lipitor patients.
  * There were no reported cases of rhabdomyolysis (a rare form of skeletal
    muscle breakdown) in patients taking Lipitor.  In Lipitor-treated
    patients, the overall incidence of elevated liver enzymes was low.
    However, elevated liver enzymes were more frequently observed in
    patients taking 80mg doses of Lipitor compared to patients taking 10mg
    doses of Lipitor.



As in all Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials, adverse events were recorded by the investigators on the basis of symptoms reported by the patient, physical examination findings and abnormal results of any laboratory tests. The adverse events were recorded during the treatment phase and up to 30 days after trial discontinuation.

Since 2004, the Lipitor 80mg dose has also been studied in the Treating to New Targets Trial (TNT) and the Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) clinical trials which have completed and published.

Since the introduction of Lipitor nearly nine years ago, its safety and effectiveness have been supported through an extensive clinical trial program, the Atorvastatin Landmark Program, with more than 400 ongoing and completed trials involving more than 80,000 patients. Lipitor is the most-prescribed cholesterol-lowering therapy in the world with more than 109 million patient years of experience.

""The knowledge that we have gained about cardiovascular disease as a result of this comprehensive clinical trial program has been instrumental in helping us better understand the benefits of the full dose range of Lipitor, which can help both physicians and patients chart the right course for cholesterol treatment."" said Dr. Larson.

About Lipitor

Lipitor(R) (atorvastatin calcium) is a prescription drug. It is used in patients with multiple risk factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol or smoking, to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke and, along with a low-fat diet, to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is used in patients with type 2 diabetes and one other risk factor such as high blood pressure, smoking, or other complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack. Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is not for women who are nursing, pregnant, or may become pregnant

If you take Lipitor, tell your doctor if you feel any unusual muscle pain or weakness. This could be a sign of serious muscle side effects. Tell your doctor about all medicines you take. This may help avoid serious drug interactions. Your doctor should do blood tests to check your liver function before and during drug treatment and may adjust your dose. The most common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. They tend to be mild and often go away.

NEW YORK, Jan. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 financial results today that reflect operating and financial strength, with performance exceeding expectations, driven by in-line medicines, new medicines, and accelerated cost savings, all while promising candidates continue to advance through the company's pipeline.

""We are supporting our key in-line and newly launched medicines, driving important new medicines through the pipeline and taking a series of specific actions to build Pfizer's value,"" said Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer. ""We completed the year with positive news on many fronts -- including double-digit full-year worldwide growth of Lipitor; an exceptional Lyrica launch in the U.S.; priority-review status for two potential breakthrough medicines, Sutent for cancer and Champix for smoking cessation; favorable decisions in Lipitor patent cases; and a 26-percent dividend increase for the first quarter of 2006. Our strategy of driving growth in our in-line medicines and investing in promising new medicines is the essence of the new Pfizer. We will continue to focus on enhancing value for our shareholders and meeting patients' needs worldwide.""

Dr. McKinnell said there were two primary drivers for Pfizer's better- than-expected performance in the quarter: better revenue performance in the Human Health business; and operating expense savings, coupled with the acceleration of the ""Adapting to Scale"" (AtS) cost savings to $800 million in 2005, which is double the goal for the year.

""While we are pleased that Pfizer's performance in 2005 exceeded previous expectations, investors should be aware that the factors driving Pfizer's performance may differ materially in 2006,"" Dr. McKinnell added. ""We look forward to providing a full briefing on our 2006 financial guidance, strategy, products, and pipeline at our analyst meeting in New York on February 10. We enter the new year with renewed determination to capitalize on all the opportunities we see to bring our innovative medicines to those who need them.""

Portfolio, Pipeline Position Human Health for Future Success

""2005 has been a challenging year for Pfizer Human Health,"" said Karen Katen, vice chairman of Pfizer Inc and president of Pfizer Human Health. ""However, fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 results indicate that we are well-positioned for the future, with a solid in-line portfolio and a rich pipeline of innovative new medicines.""

Loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of certain key medicines, uncertainty related to Celebrex, and the suspension of Bextra sales cumulatively reduced 2005 worldwide revenue by $5.7 billion. As a result, total Pfizer Human Health revenue declined $1.8 billion, or 4 percent, for full-year 2005 compared to full-year 2004. In the U.S., Human Health revenue declined 12 percent for the full-year 2005 compared to the same period in 2004.

Excluding the major medicines that lost exclusivity in the U.S. in 2004 and 2005 and the selective COX-2 inhibitors, Human Health adjusted revenues(2) grew 11 percent worldwide and 10 percent in the U.S. for full-year 2005 compared to 2004. The successful launches of seven new medicines over the past two years are enabling Pfizer to replenish our portfolio. The combined sales of these products (Inspra, Caduet, Olmetec, Macugen, Revatio, Zmax, and Lyrica) generated $284 million in fourth-quarter 2005 revenue and $632 million in full-year 2005 revenue worldwide.

Many of Pfizer's top medicines achieved double-digit growth worldwide in 2005 compared to 2004 across many therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular/metabolic diseases (Lipitor up 12 percent, Caduet up 272 percent); central nervous system disorders (Geodon up 26 percent, Relpax up 38 percent); infectious and respiratory diseases (Zyvox up 33 percent, Vfend up 38 percent); oncology (Aromasin up 73 percent); and ophthalmology (Xalatan/Xalacom up 12 percent).

Fourth-Quarter Portfolio Highlights

The cardiovascular portfolio continues to perform well. Cardiovascular sales include another billion-dollar quarter for Norvasc and continued momentum for Caduet, which achieved 323-percent revenue growth worldwide in the fourth quarter to $65 million. Worldwide sales of Lipitor totaled $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth of 3 percent over the previous year's quarter, a difficult comparison in light of Lipitor's 23- percent revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2004, exacerbated by four fewer business days in the 2005 quarter. Full-year sales of $12.2 billion reflected 12-percent growth over 2004.

In the recently published IDEAL study, Lipitor was shown to be numerically superior to Zocor in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. This difference fell just short of statistical significance (p=0.07 vs. significance at p=0.05). Lipitor did achieve statistically significant improvements in major secondary endpoints, including a 13-percent reduction in major cardiovascular events and a 17-percent reduction in non-fatal heart attacks for patients taking Lipitor 80 mg compared to patients taking simvastatin (Zocor) 20 and 40 mg. These results affirm that intensive lipid- lowering with Lipitor 80 mg can safely provide benefits beyond the most commonly prescribed doses of Zocor (20 and 40 mg) in patients with coronary artery disease.

The performance of the central nervous system portfolio was fueled by the launch of Lyrica. Since its September launch, more than 500,000 prescriptions have been written for Lyrica in the U.S. as of December 23, 2005. Lyrica had already gained more than a 7-percent new-prescription share of the U.S. anti- epileptic market as of December 23, continuing its performance as one of Pfizer's most successful pharmaceutical launches. This mirrors the outstanding launch performance seen globally. On a worldwide basis, Geodon exhibited strong full-year growth of 26 percent. This performance far outpaced the rate of market growth. In the U.S., Geodon is the second- fastest-growing atypical anti-psychotic oral medication in new-prescription volume as of November year-to-date. Its balance of powerful efficacy and a favorable metabolic profile positions it for further growth.

In the ophthalmology portfolio, the 9-percent worldwide growth in audited sales of Xalatan/Xalacom outpaced market growth (IMS MIDAS data for the twelve months ending November 2005). These medicines continue to lead the worldwide glaucoma market with a 35.7-percent share of revenues during the same period. Pfizer recently launched the first fully validated glaucoma risk calculator, which will help physicians identify patients with ocular hypertension who are most likely to progress to glaucoma, and determine whether to initiate earlier therapy. Macugen has become an important treatment in the U.S. for wet age- related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in people over 60. While new competitors are expected to enter the market, Macugen has a strong foothold with more than 40,000 patients treated to date. Macugen's favorable safety profile has been maintained for more than two years of clinical testing and marketing.

Despite decreased usage in prescription pain medications, Celebrex continues to be a leader in this field with a 46-percent share of U.S. anti- inflammatory sales and a 22-percent share worldwide for November 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Celebrex was the fastest-growing medicine in the U.S. anti-inflammatory market. Pfizer is currently supporting the Cleveland Clinic's 20,000-patient prospective study to definitively evaluate the relative safety of Celebrex and two older pain medications in patients with heart disease or at high risk of heart disease.

Worldwide full-year 2005 Viagra sales declined 2 percent. Fourth-quarter 2005 sales declined 8 percent, versus the comparable period in 2004, reflecting slower growth in the overall erectile-dysfunction (ED) market and competition from other products. Viagra continues to lead the ED market and is capturing six out of ten new prescriptions for ED in the U.S. through November 2005 year-to-date. Pfizer is supporting consumer ED education with the recent launch of a new unbranded educational campaign in the U.S.

Rich Pipeline of New Medicines Continues to Advance

""We continue to make excellent progress toward our goal of filing 20 major new medicines in the U.S. in the five-year period ending in 2006,"" said Dr. John LaMattina, President of Pfizer Global Research and Development.

In addition to the seven products launched in 2004 and 2005, six additional products are under review by the FDA. Priority review has been granted for three of these -- Sutent (sunitinib), Champix (varenicline), and Eraxis (anidulafungin).

  * Sutent is an oral agent with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity
    that may offer significant advantage to physicians treating patients
    with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and Gleevec-resistant
    gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

  * Champix, a novel partial nicotinic agonist for smoking cessation, has
    been shown to be more effective than the only other oral anti-smoking
    prescription medicine.

  * In a recent study, the antifungal agent Eraxis has shown significant
    benefit over fluconazole in the treatment of candidemia and invasive
    candidiasis and has received an approvable letter from the FDA for
    esophageal candidiasis.

  Three other products are currently under review by the FDA:

  * Exubera, the inhaled insulin drug for type 1 and type 2 diabetes,
    represents the first non-injectable form of insulin available for
    diabetics.  It has been recommended for approval by the FDA advisory
    committee and for marketing authorization by the Committee for Medicinal
    Products in Europe.  Pfizer has reached an agreement to acquire sanofi-
    aventis's share of worldwide rights to Exubera, as well as the insulin
    production facilities located in Frankfurt previously jointly owned by
    the two companies.

  * Indiplon is filed for two NDAs for the treatment of adult insomnia, in
    immediate-release and modified-release formulations.

  * We have received an approvable letter from the FDA for Zeven
    (dalbavancin), a once-weekly intravenous antibiotic for the treatment
    of complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by Gram-
    positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
    aureus.  This is Pfizer's second major product filing resulting from the
    recent acquisition of Vicuron.



""And we reached several important milestones during the fourth quarter in our ongoing efforts to bring new innovative therapies to patients around the world,"" said Dr. LaMattina.

Ticilimumab (CP-675,206), an anti-CTLA4 receptor antagonist, began Phase 3 testing in December. The compound is a monoclonal antibody and another addition in Pfizer's growing pipeline of large-molecule biologics. Ticilimumab may offer an important new option for treating metastatic melanoma, which has a five-year survival rate of less than 10 percent.

In 2005, Pfizer extended our long history of successful alliances and acquisitions with a series of agreements with Angiosyn, BioRen, Coley, Idun, Incyte, Renovis, Rigel, and Vicuron, several of which are already demonstrating strong results. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Pfizer began two Phase 3 trials for non-small-cell lung cancer using a novel anti-cancer agent PF-3512676 (formerly CpG 7909), licensed from Coley Pharmaceutical Group. Based on Phase 2 survival data, this compound may offer a significant advancement over current therapies in treating non-small-cell lung cancer.

Pfizer also entered a global collaborative research and licensing agreement with Incyte Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2005, giving us exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to a portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds for the potential treatment of inflammation. The most advanced compound is currently in Phase 2a studies in rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-resistant obese patients.

Leveraging Financial Strength

""Pfizer is undertaking a series of actions to employ the company's strong positive cash flow for the short- and long-term benefit of shareholders,"" said David Shedlarz, vice chairman. ""Given the strength of our operations, in December 2005 we increased our dividend for the first quarter of 2006 by 26 percent to 24 cents per share, while continuing to invest for long-term growth. With this increase, Pfizer will have increased dividends every year for 39 consecutive years. In 2005, we repatriated nearly $37 billion in foreign earnings, which Pfizer is using to enhance its balance sheet and invest in business opportunities. In addition, the company purchased nearly $4 billion in common stock in 2005, and it will continue to buy back its stock in 2006. Pfizer's sterling triple-A credit rating was also reaffirmed by Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

""With these and other actions, we are demonstrating to shareholders our commitment to work to enhance the value of their investment in Pfizer,"" Mr. Shedlarz concluded.

""Pfizer's earnings performance in the fourth quarter reflected operational flexibility, exceeding the estimate we announced in October 2005 for a number of reasons,"" said Alan Levin, senior vice president and chief financial officer. ""Human Health revenues were stronger than previously forecast, reflecting an unexpected two-week delay in the introduction of azithromycin (Zithromax) generics in the U.S., strong early market acceptance of Lyrica, and better-than-anticipated performance in certain key markets (Japan and Germany) and in certain key products (Zyrtec and Norvasc). The fourth quarter of 2005 had four fewer business days than the fourth quarter of 2004; this is reflected in more tempered revenues and operating expenditures for the quarter. Full-year 2005 figures reflect a comparable number of days to 2004.

""Cost of sales for the quarter remained under pressure, although the impact of changes in the geographic, product, and segment mix of our products was partially mitigated by the favorable impact of foreign exchange during the quarter. The modest rate of growth in Selling, Informational and administrative expenses and the decline in Research and Development expenditures is due in part to greater savings associated with our Adapting to Scale (AtS) initiative. For the full year, AtS savings of approximately $800 million were realized, double our original goal for the year. We also achieved approximately $4.2 billion in synergies through 2005 in connection with our acquisition and integration of Pharmacia Corporation.

""Relative to prior expectations, fourth-quarter and full-year reported net income and diluted EPS reflect our enhanced operating performance during the quarter, partially offset by higher AtS implementation costs,"" Mr. Levin concluded.

       Pfizer Continues Aggressive Defense of Intellectual Property
                With Important Lipitor, Norvasc Victories



In December 2005, Pfizer prevailed in a U.S. court decision involving a patent challenge to Lipitor, the world's most popular cholesterol-lowering medicine. The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware determined that two U.S. patents covering atorvastatin, the active ingredient in Lipitor, are valid and infringed by the product of generic manufacturer Ranbaxy Labs LTD (Ranbaxy), thus protecting Lipitor's exclusivity until June 2011.

The U.S. decision marked one more major victory over Ranbaxy, which is using legal challenges in an attempt to overturn Pfizer's atorvastatin patents in the U.S. and many other markets. In October 2005, the United Kingdom's High Court upheld the exclusivity of the basic patent covering atorvastatin. The ruling prohibits Ranbaxy from introducing a generic version of atorvastatin in the U.K. until the patent expires in November 2011. Both the U.S. and U.K. decisions have been appealed.

""Lipitor represents nothing less than one of the most important medical breakthroughs from pharmaceutical research, and the courts are sending a clear message that the legal system should support and encourage this kind of innovation,"" said Jeffrey Kindler, vice chairman and general counsel. ""We continue to believe that policymakers should examine a system in which generic companies can take as many 'shots on goal' as they wish, employing lawyers, not medical researchers, around the world to undermine confidence in research- based companies and the jobs they support. Our only course is to aggressively defend our patents and stand for principles we believe in, on behalf of the patients we serve and the future of medical innovation.""

In a separate case, Pfizer announced yesterday that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois upheld Pfizer's U.S. patent covering amlodipine besylate, the active ingredient in Norvasc, which had been challenged by the generic manufacturer Apotex.

               Disaster Relief Efforts, Access Initiatives
                     Highlight Corporate Citizenship



Pfizer continues to make progress in its initiatives to expand access to medicines and healthcare resources and to demonstrate excellence in corporate citizenship.

During 2005, the company made substantial contributions to the relief and recovery efforts in response to an unprecedented series of natural disasters, including the Asian tsunami, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the U.S. Gulf States, and the earthquake that struck Pakistan and India. In partnership with relief organizations and local authorities in the affected regions, Pfizer and its colleagues donated funds, medicines, and healthcare supplies and supported the rebuilding of critical healthcare infrastructure.

The company also advanced healthcare programs and partnerships in the developing world during 2005, including a program to train medical professionals across Africa in diagnosis and management of patients with HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis; a multi-country initiative to eliminate trachoma, the world's leading cause of preventable blindness; and a program in 42 developing countries to train healthcare providers in the treatment of opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS.

Pfizer Changing to Meet Changing Times

""While 2005 was one of the most difficult years in memory, it ended well,"" Dr. McKinnell concluded. ""2005 will be seen as a pivotal year in Pfizer's history -- the last year of the old Pfizer. We are once again doing what every generation of Pfizer colleagues has had to do since the late 1800s -- change our company to meet changing times.""

For additional details, please see the attached financial schedules, product revenue tables, supplemental financial information, and Disclosure Notice.

  (1) ""Adjusted income"" and ""adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)""
       are defined as reported net income and reported diluted EPS,
       excluding discontinued operations, cumulative effect of a change in
       accounting principles, purchase accounting adjustments, merger-
       related costs, and certain significant items.  As described under

       Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's
       Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended October 2, 2005, management
       uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals
       and to measure the performance of the overall company.  We believe
       that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by
       disclosing this measure.  A reconciliation to reported net income and
       reported diluted EPS is provided in the table accompanying this
       report.  The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are
       not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net
       income and diluted EPS.

  (2) Human Health adjusted revenues are defined as total Human Health
      revenues excluding the revenues of selective COX-2 inhibitors and
      major products that have lost exclusivity in the U.S. since the

  (1) The above financial statement presents the three-month and twelve-
      month periods ended December 31 of each year. Subsidiaries operating
      outside the United States are included for the three-month and twelve-
      month periods ended November 30 of each year.

  (2) As required, the estimated value of Merger-related in-process research
      and development charges (IPR&D) is expensed at acquisition date.  In
      2005, we expensed $1.7 billion of IPR&D, of which $1.4 billion related
      to our acquisition of Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the third
      quarter and $250 million related to our acquisition of Idun
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the second quarter.  In 2004, we expensed
      $1.1 billion of IPR&D, of which $920 million related to our
      acquisition of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. in the first quarter.

  (3) Other (income)/deductions -- net in the fourth quarter of 2004
      includes a charge of $691 million in connection with an intangible
      asset impairment related to Depo-Provera. Other (income)/deductions --
      net in 2005 includes an impairment charge of $1.2 billion related to
      the developed technology rights and the write-off of machinery and
      equipment for Bextra, a selective COX-2 inhibitor.  Other
      (income)/deductions -- net in 2004 includes a charge of $691 million
      in connection with an intangible asset impairment related to
      Depo-Provera and $369 million in connection with certain litigation-
      related charges.

  (4) Provision for taxes on income in 2005 includes tax benefits associated
      with the resolution of certain tax positions ($586 million) and taxes
      on the repatriation of foreign earnings ($1.7 billion).

  (5) In December 2005, we adopted the provisions of the Financial
      Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting
      for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), a new
      accounting interpretation issued in March 2005.  As a result, we
      recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $40 million ($25 million, net of
      tax) for costs associated with the eventual retirement of certain
      facilities. This charge is reported as a one-time cumulative effect of
      a change in accounting principle in the fourth quarter of 2005.

  (1) Human Health adjusted revenues, which excludes the revenues of
      selective COX-2 inhibitors and major products which have lost
      exclusivity in the U.S. since the beginning of 2004, is an alternative
      view of our Human Health revenue performance and we believe that
      investors' understanding of Human Health revenue growth is enhanced by
      disclosing this performance measure.  Zithromax, Neurontin, Diflucan
      and Accupril/Accuretic recently lost their U.S. exclusivity and, as is
      typical in the pharmaceutical industry, this has resulted in a
      dramatic decline in revenues due to generic competition.  Celebrex and
      Bextra, as a result of a recent regulatory evaluation of the risks and
      benefits of all COX-2 medicines, have also experienced a significant
      decline in sales.  Specifically, the regulatory review of and
      conclusions regarding Celebrex have resulted in a reduction in sales
      this year as physicians evaluate the evolving information on the risks
      and benefits of all NSAIDs and revised labeling, and on April 7, 2005,
      the FDA requested the suspension of Bextra sales and marketing based
      on its assessment of an unfavorable risk/benefit profile due to the
      additional increased risk of rare, serious skin reactions compared to
      other NSAIDs. We believe that excluding the impact of these products
      assists the reader in understanding the underlying strength of the
      balance of our diverse Human Health product portfolio in 2005.
      Because of its non-standardized definition, this adjusted Human Health
      revenues measure has limitations as it may not be comparable with the
      calculation of similar measures of other companies.  This additional
      revenue measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for
      the U.S. GAAP comparison of Human Health revenue growth.

                                PFIZER INC
                    SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

  1)  Impact of Foreign Exchange on Revenues



Changes in foreign-exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2005 relative to the same period in the prior year had a nominally favorable impact on revenue growth of $36 million, or 0.2%. The weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the euro, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, and British pound, for the twelve months of 2005 compared to the twelve months of 2004 favorably impacted full-year 2005 revenues by $945 million, or 1.8%.

2) Impact of Accounting Calendar on Revenues

Pfizer's accounting calendar had three additional business days in the first quarter relative to 2004. Pfizer's second and third fiscal quarters of 2005 had the same number of business days as the prior year. The fourth quarter, however, had four fewer business days than the prior year (six fewer calendar days).

3) Change in Cost of Sales

Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 17.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 15.8% in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in the cost of sales margin principally reflects unfavorable geographic, segment, and product mix; adverse changes in production volume; and AtS costs ($87 million); partially offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange.

Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 16.6% for the twelve months of 2005 from 14.4% for the twelve months of 2004. The increase reflects unfavorable geographic, segment, and product mix; adverse changes in production volume; AtS costs ($124 million); and costs associated with Bextra ($73 million), among other factors.

4) Costs Relating to Adapting to Scale Productivity Initiative

Costs relating to the Adapting to Scale (AtS) initiative were $470 million and $780 million, pre-tax, for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2005. We expect the costs associated with this multi-year effort to continue through 2008 and to total $4 billion to $5 billion, on a pre-tax basis. The actions associated with the AtS initiative will include restructuring charges -- such as asset impairments, exit costs, and severance and severance-related costs -- and associated implementation costs, such as accelerated depreciation charges, primarily associated with plant network optimization efforts, and expenses associated with system and process standardization and the expansion of shared services.

5) Merger-Related Costs

Pharmacia merger-related costs totaled $928 million for 2005. Cumulative costs from 2002 through 2005 were $5.4 billion, consistent with expectations at the time of the acquisition. Merger-related synergies through 2005 totaled approximately $4.2 billion. Pharmacia merger-related initiatives are essentially complete, and we will not incur material Pharmacia merger-related costs going forward.

  * Certain 2004 amounts were reclassified to conform to the 2005
    presentation.



In connection with the decision to suspend sales of Bextra in the first quarter of 2005, we recorded a charge of $1.1 billion relating to the impairment of Bextra's intangible assets for developed technology rights and the write-off of machinery and equipment of $5 million.

In the third quarter of 2004, Pfizer recorded a litigation-related charge of $369 million related to the resolution of claims against Quigley Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a non-cash charge of $691 million upon determining that an indefinite-lived intangible asset relating to Depo-Provera had become impaired.

7) Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate used in calculating reported income for 2005 is 29.7%. The effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted income(1) is 22.2%. The difference between the adjusted tax rate and the reported tax rate primarily reflects the tax impact on foreign earnings repatriated pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act, resolution of certain tax positions, as well as the tax impacts of purchase accounting and the Bextra impairment.

8) Share-Purchase Program

We believe that purchase of our stock is an excellent investment opportunity. Since the beginning of 1999, Pfizer has purchased more than $35.6 billion of its common stock. In the second quarter of 2005, the company completed the $5 billion share-purchase program authorized in October 2004. On June 23, 2005, Pfizer announced the authorization of a new $5 billion share-purchase program. By the end of 2005, Pfizer had purchased approximately 22 million shares valued at approximately $493 million under the new program. In total, the company purchased nearly 144 million shares of common stock, valued at $3.8 billion, during 2005. We remain committed to completing our new $5 billion share-purchase program.

214,Pfizer2,"European Commission Approves Exubera(R) (Inhaled Human Insulin) for Treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes; CEO McKinnell: 'Exubera is a Major, First-of-its-Kind, Medical Breakthrough That Marks Another Critical Step Forward in the Treatment of Diabetes, a Disease That Has Taken an Enormous Human and Economic Toll Worldwide'; First Non-Injectable, Inhalable Insulin Approved Since the Discovery of Insulin; Simple-to-Use, Hand-Held Device and Easy Option for Those Failing Other Therapies; New Treatment Option for People with Diabetes Who Are Not Adequately Controlled with Diabetes Pills or Insulin Injections; Diabetes is the Fourth Leading Cause of Death Worldwide and More Than 48 Million People in Europe Suffer from Diabetes-the Most Common Cause of Blindness, Amputations, Kidney Failure, Heart Attack and Nerve Damage",,"1,370 words",26 January 2006,12:04 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that the European Commission has approved Exubera (inhaled human insulin) for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Exubera is the first non-injectable, inhalable form of insulin to be approved since the discovery of insulin in the 1920s, and represents a major advance in diabetes treatment.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes has reached epidemic proportions and affects approximately 48 million people in Europe alone. People with diabetes often suffer from debilitating complications due to uncontrolled blood sugar levels including heart disease, amputation, blindness and kidney failure. The direct healthcare costs associated with diabetes are estimated to be around $286 billion worldwide, with the majority of these costs linked to treating diabetes-related complications.","Since its discovery more than 80 years ago, insulin has been the gold standard treatment for diabetes. In order to achieve tight blood sugar control, insulin is often administered before meals to mimic the body's natural insulin response to food. Healthcare providers and patients have been reluctant to initiate or intensify insulin therapy when it is required due to the need for daily injections.

""Exubera is a major, first-of-its-kind, medical breakthrough that marks another critical step forward in the treatment of diabetes, a disease that has taken an enormous human and economic toll worldwide,"" said Hank McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ""The global incidence of diabetes is currently at epidemic levels. Millions of patients are not achieving or maintaining acceptable blood sugar levels, despite the availability of current therapies. Exubera meets a critical medical need by offering a highly effective and needle-free alternative to diabetes pills and insulin injections to manage this complicated, debilitating disease.""

Exubera is a fast-acting, dry powder formulation of human insulin that is inhaled into the lungs via the mouth before meals using a simple-to-use, hand-held device that does not require batteries or electricity. The device, which weighs four ounces and is about the size of a carrying case for a pair of eye glasses, is designed to deliver an accurate and precise dose of insulin each time it is used.

Exubera is the result of one of the most rigorous and innovative diabetes development programs ever and Pfizer's investment now stands at over $1 billion. Pfizer invested in two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities -- the world's largest insulin plant in Frankfurt, Germany, and a high-tech facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, U.S. -- well ahead of regulatory actions, so that the product can reach patients as quickly as possible.

The efficacy and safety profile of Exubera was studied in more than 2,500 adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes for an average duration of 20 months. In studies in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, Exubera was shown to be as effective as injectable insulin in achieving glycemic control. In adults with type 2 diabetes who are not sufficiently controlled with commonly used oral therapies, Exubera has been shown to provide greater improvements in glycemic control. In addition, patients who took Exubera reported greater overall treatment satisfaction and acceptance compared to insulin injections or oral therapies.

""This is really good news for physicians and patients. It is truly a clinical and scientific milestone -- being able to give insulin without needles,"" said Chantal Mathieu, Professor of Endocrinology, University of Leuven, Belgium. ""Physicians face many challenges with insulin therapy due to patients' reluctance to take injections, which up until now, was the only way to take insulin. With Exubera, patients now have another opportunity to take control of their blood sugar and take an active role in managing this complicated disease.""

About Exubera

To further support the effective use of Exubera, Pfizer is investing in extensive educational programs to support healthcare professionals and patients.

Exubera is a product of a collaboration between Pfizer Inc and Nektar Therapeutics. Pfizer recently reached an agreement to acquire the sanofi-aventis worldwide rights to Exubera. The two companies were previously in a worldwide alliance to co-develop, co-promote and co-manufacture Exubera.

In the European Union, Exubera has been approved for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes (greater than 18 years of age) not adequately controlled with oral antidiabetic agents and requiring insulin therapy. Exubera is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in addition to long or intermediate acting injectable insulin, for whom the potential benefits of adding inhaled insulin outweigh the potential safety concerns.

Exubera is pending approval in the U.S. In September 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee recommended that Exubera should be approved for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

There are two major forms of diabetes -- type 1 and type 2. In type 1, which typically develops in childhood, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas have been destroyed leading to a complete lack of insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the most common and progressive form of the disease, the body does not effectively use nor produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, and eventually most people with type 2 diabetes will need insulin to achieve blood sugar control.

Important Safety Information about Exubera

The safety profile and tolerability of Exubera have been extensively studied in clinical trials. Adverse events throughout the clinical development program were generally mild to moderate, and discontinuation rates were low.

Patients should not take Exubera if they have poorly controlled or unstable lung disease, or if they smoke or have stopped smoking less than six months prior to starting Exubera treatment. If a patient starts smoking or resumes smoking, he or she must stop using Exubera and see a health care provider about a different treatment.

Before starting treatment with Exubera, a health care provider will carry out a simple test to check lung function. The test involves exhaling into a measuring device. This will help to find out if Exubera is the right treatment for individual patients. Once a patient starts treatment, it is recommended that a health care provider should check lung function again at six months (see full prescribing information).

A small decrease in lung function may occur during Exubera treatment although symptoms might not be noticeable. This change occurs within the first months of treatment and should not worsen as treatment is continued.

Like all medicines, Exubera can cause side effects. As with all forms of insulin, a possible side effect of Exubera is low blood sugar levels.

Some patients have reported a mild cough while taking Exubera, which occurred within seconds to minutes after Exubera inhalation. Coughing occurred less frequently as patients continued to use Exubera.

Consecutive inhalation of three 1mg unit dose blisters causes a significantly higher insulin exposure than inhalation of one 3mg unit dose blister. Therefore, three 1mg unit dose blisters should not be substituted for one 3mg unit dose blister.

219,Pfizer2,"Pfizer's Lyrica Receives Positive Opinion From CHMP for the Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Adults; Under-Recognized, Poorly-Treated and Stigmatized Condition Frequently Associated with High Levels of Patient Distress and Impairment; UK Expert: Psychological and Physical Effects of GAD Disrupt Work and Personal Relationships and Make it Difficult to Carry on with Everyday Activities",,544 words,27 January 2006,11:24 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization of Lyrica(R) (pregabalin), a novel mechanism for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults.

The CHMP's positive recommendation will be reviewed by the European Commission, which has authority to approve medicines for the European Union. Pfizer anticipates a final decision from the Commission in the coming months.","""Though GAD has been formally recognized by the medical community and is frequently associated with high levels of distress and impairment, the condition often goes undetected and untreated,"" said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer. ""It is estimated that only one-third of those who suffer from this condition seek treatment despite the significant impact on patient quality of life. We are pleased that the CHMP has recognized the potential therapeutic benefits of Lyrica in treating this serious medical condition.""

GAD, which affects an estimated five percent of people at some point in their lives, is a psychiatric disorder characterized by excessive worry as well as physical symptoms such as poor sleep, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability and restlessness. GAD affects slightly more women than men, and symptoms are often chronic and worsen during times of stress. GAD occurs more frequently in patients with chronic medical illnesses, particularly in connection with pain syndromes. The direct annual healthcare costs associated with GAD in Europe are approximately $1.5 billion.

""Despite frequent visits to their doctor, GAD patients are still very poorly treated."" said Dr. Stuart Montgomery, Professor of Psychiatry, Imperial College School of Medicine, University of London. ""The psychological and physical effects of GAD disrupt work and personal relationships and make it difficult to carry on with everyday activities. Accurate diagnosis of GAD is important since prolonged anxiety increases impairment and worsens the outcome of co-existing physical illnesses.""

Lyrica has been approved for various neuropathic pain indications including peripheral neuropathic pain, diabetic and postherpetic neuropathic pain and adjunctive therapy for epilepsy in more than 50 countries outside of the United States. The most common adverse events in Lyrica's clinical development program were dizziness and somnolence. In the U.S., Lyrica(R) (pregabalin) capsules C-V is FDA approved for the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures. Developed by Pfizer, Lyrica is an alpha-2-delta ligand that is believed to work by calming hyper-excited neurons.

220,Pfizer2,"Pfizer Receives FDA Approval for Exubera, the First Inhalable Form of Insulin for Controlling Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes in Adults; CEO McKinnell: 'Exubera is a Major, First-of-its-Kind, Medical Breakthrough That Marks Another Critical Step Forward in the Treatment of Diabetes, a Disease that Has Taken an Enormous Human and Economic Toll Worldwide'; Innovative Hand-Held Insulin Device Effectively Controls Diabetes and Provides Reliable and Easy to Use Insulin Dosing; Patient with Type 2 Diabetes: 'With Exubera, I've Been Able to Control my Blood Sugar Levels and Not Constantly Worry About How I Manage My Diabetes.'; Diabetes is the Fifth Leading Cause of Death in the U.S. and Accounts for $132 Billion in Annual Healthcare Costs",,"1,189 words",27 January 2006,04:35 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Jan. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that Exubera(R) (insulin human [rDNA origin]) Inhalation Powder has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Exubera was found in clinical trials to be as effective as short-acting insulin injections, and to significantly improve blood sugar control when added to diabetes pills. Exubera, which is expected to be available for patients by mid-year, is the first inhaled form of insulin and the first insulin option that does not need to be administered by injection in the United States.","""Exubera is a major, first-of-its-kind, medical breakthrough that marks another critical step forward in the treatment of diabetes, a disease that has taken an enormous human and economic toll worldwide,"" said Hank McKinnell, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. ""The global incidence of diabetes is currently at epidemic levels. Millions of patients are not achieving or maintaining acceptable blood sugar levels, despite the availability of current therapies. Exubera meets a critical medical need by offering a highly effective and needle-free alternative to diabetes pills and insulin injections to manage this complicated, debilitating disease.""

Exubera is a rapid-acting, dry powder human insulin that is inhaled through the mouth into the lungs prior to eating, using the handheld Exubera Inhaler. The Exubera inhaler weighs four ounces and, when closed, is about the size of an eyeglass case. The unique Exubera Inhaler produces in its chamber a cloud of insulin powder, which is designed to pass rapidly into the bloodstream to regulate the body's blood sugar levels.

Exubera Meets Medical Need

""Many people who could benefit from insulin are fearful of injections, so they delay treatment five years or ten years, placing them at risk for serious complications. Now, for the first time patients can improve blood sugar control with fewer or no painful injections,"" said Dr. William Cefalu, Exubera investigator and chief of the division of nutrition and chronic diseases at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, a campus of the Louisiana State University System, in Baton Rouge.

The efficacy and safety profile of Exubera was studied in more than 2,500 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes for an average duration of 20 months. In clinical trials, many patients using Exubera reported greater treatment satisfaction than patients taking insulin by injection. Significantly more patients who had used both Exubera and insulin injections or diabetes pills reported an overall preference for Exubera.

""With Exubera, I've been able to control my blood sugar levels and not constantly worry about how I manage my diabetes,"" said Jamie Villastrigo, a type 2 diabetes patient and Exubera clinical trial participant.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, Exubera can be used alone as an alternative to rapid-acting insulin injections or diabetes pills, or in combination with diabetes pills or longer-acting insulin. In patients with type 1 diabetes, Exubera will be used in combination with longer-acting insulin.

The Burden of Diabetes in the United States

Complications commonly associated with uncontrolled or poorly controlled blood sugar levels include heart disease, amputation, blindness and kidney failure. Diabetes and its complications are estimated to account for $132 billion in direct and indirect health care costs annually.

Nearly 21 million Americans have diabetes and approximately 95 percent of these people have type 2 diabetes.

In type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well enough to manage blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes progresses over time, and eventually most patients will need to administer insulin to achieve blood sugar control. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not make insulin at all. These patients must take insulin to survive.

All people with type 1 diabetes and a large percentage of people with type 2 diabetes need treatment with insulin. While insulin has been proven to be effective to reduce blood sugar levels and the risk of complications, health care providers and patients often have been unwilling to start treatment. Factors include patients' fear of injections and social embarrassment associated with needles.

Exubera is the result of one of the most rigorous and innovative diabetes development programs. Pfizer has invested in two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities -- the world's largest insulin plants in Frankfurt, Germany, and a highly automated, high-tech production facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.

Exubera is a product of a collaboration between Pfizer and Nektar Therapeutics. Pfizer recently reached an agreement to acquire the sanofi- aventis worldwide rights to Exubera. The two companies were previously in a worldwide alliance to co-develop, co-promote and co-manufacture Exubera.

Important Safety Information about Exubera

Patients should not take Exubera if they smoke or have stopped smoking less than six months prior to starting Exubera treatment. If a patient starts smoking or resumes smoking, he or she must stop using Exubera and see a health care provider about a different treatment.

Exubera may affect lung function so patients need to have their lungs tested before starting Exubera, and periodically thereafter, as directed by a healthcare provider. The test involves exhaling into a measuring device. Exubera is not recommended for people that have chronic lung disease (such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema). Also, Exubera should not be used at all by people with unstable or poorly controlled lung disease.

Like all medicines, Exubera can cause side effects. As with all forms of insulin, a possible side effect of Exubera is low blood sugar levels. Some patients have reported a mild cough while taking Exubera, which occurred within seconds to minutes after Exubera inhalation. Coughing occurred less frequently as patients continued to use Exubera.

Patients and health care providers can call 1-800-EXUBERA and register to receive more information about Exubera when it is available. The hotline can be accessed in English.

228,Pfizer2,"European Commission Approves Macugen for Treatment of All Types of Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration; First Treatment to Target Underlying Disease Process of Wet AMD; ""Each year there are an estimated 500,000 new cases of Wet AMD worldwide, so new treatment options are crucially important""",,810 words,2 February 2006,12:14 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Feb. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization for Macugen(R) (pegaptanib sodium injection) for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age- related macular degeneration (AMD), an age-related eye disease that destroys central vision critical to reading, driving and color vision.

Macugen is the first treatment to target the underlying disease process and has been proven to help preserve visual acuity in patients with wet AMD. Clinical studies showed that Macugen prevented severe vision loss at twice the rate of standard care, which included photodynamic therapy.","""Macugen represents an important treatment advance for this leading cause of irreversible vision loss,"" said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer. ""Macugen is the first therapy indicated in Europe for the treatment of all types of wet AMD, regardless of lesion subtype, size or visual acuity. Pfizer is committed to bringing innovative medicines to patients facing the loss of vision caused by wet AMD, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and other diseases of the eye.""

Wet AMD is a chronic, progressive disease of the macula, the central portion of the retina responsible for sight that allows people to see faces, walk stairs and engage in daily activities. Central vision is impaired when abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the macula, known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), causes bleeding and other fluid accumulation in the retina.

""While the problem of wet AMD is a global one, it hits particularly hard in areas with rapidly aging populations, such as Europe,"" said Steve Winyard, chairman of the AMD Alliance International. ""Each year there are an estimated 500,000 new cases of wet AMD worldwide, so new treatment options are crucially important.""

About Macugen

Macugen is indicated for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.

Macugen is the first of a new type of ophthalmic drug that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF 165), a protein that acts as a signal in triggering CNV, the single disease process underlying all subtypes of wet AMD. By selectively binding to VEGF 165, Macugen reduces blood vessel growth and leakage, thereby limiting the progression of vision loss and helping patients preserve the vision they have.

The approval was based on the results of two pivotal clinical trials involving 1,186 patients with all subtypes of wet AMD. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients protected from a three-line loss of visual acuity on the eye chart by week 54. Seventy percent of patients who had 0.3 mg of Macugen every six weeks lost fewer than three lines of vision on the eye chart, compared with 55 percent of patients in the control group -- a 27 percent treatment benefit. After one year, patients were randomized to continue or discontinue treatment for another year. Two-year clinical data from the studies demonstrated a continued treatment benefit with Macugen and that treatment should be initiated as early as possible.

Overall, Macugen was well tolerated. Patients on Macugen for two years received over 90 percent of possible injections, indicating strong compliance and acceptance to therapy. Most of the adverse events reported over the two years were mild in severity, transient and attributed by investigators to the injection procedure rather than the study drug.

Macugen is contraindicated in patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infection or with known hypersensitivity to the active or inactive substances.

Rare post-marketing cases of an allergic reaction have been reported in patients within several hours after injection with Macugen, although a direct relationship to Macugen or other factors has not been established.

The safety and efficacy of Macugen beyond two years have not been demonstrated.

Macugen has been approved by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Pakistan and the Philippines, with filings submitted in 15 other countries. More than 50,000 patients with wet AMD have been treated with Macugen in the United States last year. Macugen is an important addition to a Pfizer ophthalmology portfolio that includes market-leading glaucoma medications Xalatan/Xalacom.

Pfizer has an exclusive license from OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to develop and market Macugen outside of the United States. Pfizer and OSI jointly develop and market Macugen in the United States.

237,Pfizer2,"New Peer-To-Peer, Diabetes Self-Management Program to Address Health Disparities in Underserved Populations; Pfizer Health Solutions and Community HealthCare Center, an Alliance of Volunteers in Medicine, Collaborate to Offer a Culturally Relevant Health Education Program to People with Diabetes",,910 words,7 February 2006,12:16 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"SAVANNAH, Ga., Feb. 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Pfizer Health Solutions Inc (PHS) and Community Healthcare Center (CHC) have officially launched a culturally appropriate diabetes education program to help reduce health disparities for people with diabetes among Savannah's Hispanic and African American communities. The Amigos En Salud(TM) (""Friends in Health"") program is based on a community health worker (CHW) model which educates, empowers and motivates people with diabetes to help them better manage their disease, which in turn leads to improved health and lower health care costs in local communities.","CHC is a member of the Volunteers in Medicine (VIM) Alliance of Free Clinics that provides free primary health care to the medically uninsured and underinsured. In Georgia, where VIM has helped establish four other clinics in Brunswick, Jasper, Macon and Warner Robins, 15 percent of those with a household income of less than $15,000 have diabetes, more than twice the state average of 6.8 percent.(i) Local CHWs have been trained to offer group and individual health education to people with diabetes and their family members so they can learn new techniques to better manage their health. Diabetes is often accompanied by other serious health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and depression, and requires individuals to make changes in their lifestyle, such as eating healthy, being more physically active, and consistently monitoring their blood sugar.

""The Amigos en Salud program will give Savannah's underserved population with diabetes the education and tools to help them take control of their own health,"" said Julia Portale, director of community health, PHS. ""Amigos en Salud provides access to local community health workers and resources that complement each person's culture and individual lifestyles.""

Amigos en Salud is now available to eligible individuals with diabetes in Chatham County. The program is designed to help participants achieve clinical and behavioral health outcomes that mirror the American Diabetes Association standards of care, including glycemic control and lifestyle modification related to healthy eating and regular physical activity.

""The trained community health workers will support CHC health care professionals by providing follow-up and social support to patients, helping them overcome cultural, language or behavioral barriers to treatment,"" said Miriam Rittmeyer, M.D., Executive Director of CHC. ""We believe this community- based approach will improve the health of the people we serve in Savannah and is a promising approach to improve care and reduce health care costs by helping prevent serious complications of diabetes.""

About Amigos en Salud

Amigos en Salud, which translates to ""Friends in Health,"" is a culturally appropriate diabetes self-management program that addresses cultural perceptions and lifestyles. The Amigos en Salud program is designed to help patients with diabetes understand their condition, encourage and sustain behavior change, support development of self-management skills, and provide ongoing community support -- in the context of individual cultures.

The program uses trained community health workers, working collaboratively with health care practitioners, to provide individual and group health education sessions to support patients with diabetes. The CHWs also work directly with patients and family members to develop and implement culturally relevant behavior change strategies, using bilingual education materials at the appropriate literacy level, as necessary.

Since 2002, the Amigos program, developed by Pfizer Health Solutions, has been implemented in multiple communities throughout the United States: Laredo and Brownsville, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Hartford, Connecticut; and Jersey City, New Jersey. In these pilot programs, the patients who participated showed improvement in the American Diabetes Association's goal of lowered HbA1c and LDL cholesterol and exhibited improved adherence to diabetes process measures, including nutrition counseling, eye exams, foot exams, physician visits, and obtaining HbA1c tests. Behavioral changes, like eating healthy and exercising, also significantly improved.

About Community HealthCare Center / Volunteers in Medicine

Community HealthCare Center provides access to primary health care in a dignified and compassionate way to people between the ages of 18 and 64 years who live or work in Chatham County and meet certain financial criteria.

The Community HealthCare Center is modeled on the nationally successful Volunteers in Medicine (VIM) movement in which local communities develop free health care clinics staffed primarily by retired medical professionals willing to volunteer their services to care for the uninsured. The number of retirees willing to volunteer is expected to grow exponentially as the baby boomers come into retirement.

241,Pfizer2,Pfizer Petitions FDA to Recall Teva and Sandoz Generic Azithromycin Products to Correct Misbranding; --- Pfizer Charges Teva and Sandoz With Patent Infringement,,419 words,8 February 2006,05:06 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Feb. 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that it has filed a Citizen Petition alerting the FDA that generic azithromycin products sold by Teva Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. and Sandoz Inc. appear to be misbranded because their labels do not accurately describe the drugs' active ingredients.

Pfizer also has brought patent infringement actions against the two companies claiming that these products violate a recently-issued Pfizer patent. The Teva and Sandoz drugs are generic versions of Pfizer's antibiotic, Zithromax(R).","Pfizer's petition asks the FDA to initiate a recall of the Teva and Sandoz medicines to correct their misbranding. Pfizer also asks the agency to review the product approval applications filed by the two companies to ensure the information contained within them is accurate and complete and, if not, to take appropriate remedial action.

""Patients and physicians must be able to trust that the medicine in the bottle is the same as that which is described in the label,"" said Hank McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ""Pfizer wants to ensure that patients do not receive generic products that fail to meet FDA standards.""

In its patent infringement actions, Pfizer is claiming that the Teva and Sandoz products violate a recently-issued Pfizer patent covering azithromycin sesquihydrate. Pfizer is requesting that the court impose preliminary and permanent injunctions against further sales of the drugs.

Pfizer alleges that the drugs contain significant amounts of azithromycin sesquihydrate rather than the azithromycin monohydrate that they claim in their labels. Both Pfizer's Zithromax(R) and a generic azithromycin launched by the company's Greenstone subsidiary contain azithromycin dihydrate, which is the product approved in Pfizer's NDA. Zithromax's composition-of-matter patent in the U.S. expired in November 2005.

Teva and Sandoz each launched their generic products in November, 2005. In response to those launches, Greenstone introduced its generic azithromycin in the same month. Pfizer will continue to market its generic azithromycin through Greenstone.

NEW YORK, Feb. 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc is executing a wide-ranging strategy to transform all areas of its business, grow current and new medicines, drive productivity improvements and launch innovative patient-centered healthcare initiatives.

Addressing financial analysts here today, Pfizer outlined its drivers of value for 2006-2008, including growth of its key in-line medicines, an increasingly substantial contribution from new medicines, enhanced R&D productivity supporting a broad and promising pipeline of new medicines, and streamlining to reduce costs and speed decision-making in all parts of the company.

""This is a time of transformation for Pfizer and our industry,"" said Hank McKinnell, Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ""We are responding directly to the realities of our operating environment as we build value today while aggressively investing in the future. We have many significant opportunities ahead of us.

""We are rapidly adapting our business to effectively balance the demands of our customers, the needs of patients, and the interests of shareholders. Over the next three years, a new generation Pfizer will emerge, and our company will have the operating and financial strength to sustain value.""

Key Elements of Financial Forecast and Strategy to Build Shareholder Value

""Pfizer is aggressively transforming itself in all aspects of its business -- challenging the old ways and taking risks with new directions and innovations -- in sales, marketing, R&D, and manufacturing,"" said Vice Chairman David Shedlarz. ""While near-term results will be tempered by loss of exclusivity of older medicines, we see a bright, long-term future driven by growth of current and new medicines, productivity enhancements and new initiatives to enhance shareholder value.""

Revenue Growth. Pfizer expects sustained growth from key medicines and an increasingly large contribution from new medicines, which will offset the impact of loss of exclusivity. The company is reallocating resources to ensure the highest growth from its portfolio of important medicines.

Productivity Enhancements. The Adapting to Scale initiative will continue to produce substantial cost savings while creating a more efficient company. Adapting to Scale spans all functions, processes and geographies, with specific programs focused on enhancing R&D productivity, optimizing the field force, consolidating our network of manufacturing plants and optimizing the procurement of goods and services.

Initiatives to Enhance Shareholder Value. Pfizer will continue to use its strong cash flow from operations to enhance shareholder value. The company is focused on three important initiatives to leverage cash flow: increasing our dividend payout and yield, purchasing shares, and changing Pfizer's business portfolio, including the recently announced decision to explore strategic alternatives for Pfizer Consumer Healthcare (PCH).

Financial Guidance. Mr. Shedlarz said the financial impact of these and other transformational efforts are expected to result in the following guidance for 2006 performance:

  -- 2006 Revenues comparable to 2005, as growth of current and new products
     offsets revenue declines from loss of exclusivity and adverse foreign
     exchange
  -- 2006 Reported Diluted EPS of $1.52 to $1.56
  -- 2006 Adjusted Diluted EPS* comparable to 2005 at about $2.00, including
     the adverse impact of stock-option expensing and foreign exchange
  -- Mid-single-digit Adjusted Diluted EPS* growth in 2006, without the
     adverse impact of stock-option expensing and foreign exchange
  -- Modest improvement in 2006 of Adjusted Gross Margins** versus 2005
  -- Cost savings from the Adapting to Scale productivity initiative of
     about $2 billion in 2006
  -- 2006 operating cash flow of more than $16 billion
  -- 26 percent growth in the first-quarter 2006 dividend
  -- At least $1 billion in 2006 share purchases



Regarding performance in 2007 and 2008, Mr. Shedlarz provided the following guidance:

  -- Revenue growth is expected to resume in 2007, as contributions from new
     medicines and sustained in-line medicine growth more than offset the
     declining impact of loss of exclusivity
  -- Cost savings from the Adapting to Scale initiative of about $3.5
     billion by 2007 and of about $4 billion by 2008
  -- High-single-digit average annual growth in Adjusted Diluted EPS* over
     the two-year period of 2007-2008
  -- Continued strong growth in cash flow from operations anticipated to
     more than $19 billion by 2008



Earlier this week, Pfizer said it would explore strategic alternatives for its consumer healthcare business. ""This is the right time to undertake this review, given the premium the marketplace is placing on similar large, high-quality consumer businesses,"" Mr. Shedlarz said. ""We expect to make this decision in the third quarter of 2006.""

Pfizer Consumer Healthcare has a well-balanced product portfolio anchored by key brands including Listerine, Benadryl and Visine, and broad geographic presence. The business has maintained a strong, consistent financial performance, with high margins and stable cash flows. The business had 2005 segment revenues of $3.9 billion and pre-tax segment income of about $700 million. The median multiple of stock-price-to-2005 earnings for consumer healthcare companies is 21. If this multiple were applied to PCH, it could be valued as a stand-alone business at more than $10 billion.

     Pfizer Expects Strong Growth of Current and Emerging Medicines;
            New Growth to Offset Impact of Patent Expirations



Karen Katen, vice chairman and president of Pfizer Human Health, said, ""We are expecting strong growth for Lipitor, Celebrex and Lyrica in 2006, and we see excellent prospects for a number of new medicines we plan to launch this year. These include recently approved Sutent and Exubera, breakthrough treatments for cancer and diabetes, respectively, as well as our smoking cessation medicine Champix, which is currently under priority review by the FDA.""

Ms. Katen said the company expects sales of Lipitor, the world's most-prescribed medicine, to exceed $13 billion in 2006. ""We continue to enhance the Lipitor label -- including a new indication for reducing strokes -- and differentiate Lipitor with high-impact economic data demonstrating its benefits. In addition, Lipitor is performing well against generic simvastatin in many markets where the two medicines compete. This shows our efforts to communicate Lipitor's tremendous value in reducing cardiovascular events are effective. Given the large numbers of untreated patients, Lipitor has excellent opportunities to grow even further,"" Ms. Katen said.

""Going forward, we are going to highlight the benefits of Lipitor with new economic data demonstrating that Lipitor prevents costly cardiovascular events and associated healthcare costs while providing better overall cardiovascular health to patients,"" Ms. Katen said.

The company anticipates that sales of Celebrex will increase to more than $2 billion in 2006 and that sales of Lyrica will triple to more than $900 million. ""Celebrex is showing strong signs of growth with new prescription trends in the U.S. climbing steadily since October,"" Ms. Katen said. ""In the fourth quarter of 2005, we saw an increase of 8 percent in new Celebrex prescriptions while those for branded NSAIDs fell nearly 3 percent.""

Celebrex offers clear gastrointestinal (GI) advantages. ""Epidemiological data indicate that Celebrex has lower rates of GI bleeding requiring hospitalization than other highly prescribed pain relievers like naproxen and ibuprofen,"" Ms. Katen said. ""This GI profile also was confirmed in recent study results published in the British Medical Journal.""

To further characterize Celebrex's cardiovascular profile, Pfizer is funding the first large-scale safety study of Celebrex and traditional NSAIDs in patients with heart disease or those at high risk for heart disease. The Pfizer-funded study is being run independently by the Cleveland Clinic and will involve 20,000 patients worldwide.

Lyrica sales are outpacing those of other medicines that treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain. ""Physicians are prescribing Lyrica because of the positive experiences their patients are having,"" Ms. Katen said. ""In one survey, 70 percent of doctors cited rapid pain relief as an attribute they associate with Lyrica."" Pfizer is aggressively pursuing additional indications including generalized anxiety disorder, fibromyalgia and other neuropathic pain conditions.

Ms. Katen said Pfizer expects strong long-term performance for a number of new medicines, in many cases exceeding the expectations of financial analysts. Key product highlights include:

  -- Exubera, one of the most important innovations in diabetes treatment
     since the discovery of insulin in the 1920s.  Pfizer anticipates
     exceptional uptake for this fast-acting inhaled form of insulin due to
     better control of blood sugar without injections.
  -- Sutent, a novel treatment for two difficult-to-treat cancers.  Sutent
     offers new hope to patients who otherwise have no options.  Because of
     Sutent's unique mechanism of action, it has potential to treat other
     more common malignancies, and Pfizer is aggressively pursuing
     additional indications.
  -- Champix, Pfizer's smoking cessation medicine currently under FDA
     priority review, is expected to be a major advance in improving health
     worldwide.  Discovered and developed by Pfizer, Champix has
     demonstrated radically improved quit rates compared to other leading
     smoking cessation products.  Champix is unique in that it diminishes
     cravings while also decreasing the reward smokers get from cigarettes.



In addition, Pfizer expects to launch indiplon for insomnia, the antifungal medicine Eraxis, and Zeven, an antibiotic.

Pfizer has realigned its U.S. business in response to the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. In 2006, Pfizer estimates that Medicare Part D sales will represent about 20 percent of total U.S. sales, expanding to double that by 2008. Ms. Katen said Pfizer is well positioned in the Medicare marketplace with the majority of the company's key medicines represented on formularies.

""In addition, we restructured our U.S. field force to mirror the new regional structure under Medicare,"" Ms. Katen said. ""This has resulted in our representatives spending more time in the field with less duplication, enabling us to build even stronger relationships with physicians and Medicare prescription drug plans.""

Ms. Katen also said Pfizer is competing effectively in the generic market in the U.S. through the company's Greenstone subsidiary, which offers high-quality generic medicines to U.S. consumers.

""We are mindful that, with increasing life expectancy and a growing number of new medical innovations, the demand for healthcare will only increase,"" Ms. Katen said. ""At the same time, budgets will be further constrained, putting even greater pressure on the healthcare system. Through a series of initiatives, Pfizer is investing in prevention and wellness and helping patients proactively manage chronic diseases, which ultimately will better control total healthcare costs.""

Productivity Improvements Drive Pipeline Expansion

Dr. John LaMattina, president of Pfizer Global Research and Development, highlighted the company's progress in three areas: enhancing R&D productivity, advancing the company's pipeline of new medicines and expanding the scope of Pfizer R&D.

Dr. LaMattina said Pfizer is achieving productivity improvements through a focus on the quality and quantity of new medicine candidates. ""Our dual focus on improving both candidate output and candidate quality is setting the foundation for sustained R&D productivity in the years to come,"" he said. With these enhancements, Pfizer's objective is to ultimately deliver four medicines per year from the company's internal research efforts.

Pfizer's pipeline continues to grow and now consists of 235 total projects, including 152 novel compounds and 83 product enhancements. ""We have successfully streamlined and restructured our organization. Our pipeline is now 8 percent larger than at the end of 2004,"" Dr. LaMattina said.

Pfizer has completed 17 filings for approval of new medicines since 2001, 11 of which are approved and on the market. Dr. LaMattina added that the company expects two additional filings in 2006 -- one for maraviroc, a CCR-5 antagonist in Phase III studies for treatment of HIV/AIDS, and one through a licensing opportunity the company expects to announce in the first half of the year.

Dr. LaMattina said Pfizer is targeting three additional NDA filings in 2007, including torcetrapib/atorvastatin for cholesterol management, the schizophrenia medicine asenapine and ticilimumab, a new therapy for serious and life-threatening cancers.

In describing the expanding scope of Pfizer's R&D activities, Dr. LaMattina said the company has established a firm foothold in biologics with medicines including Genotropin and Macugen, among others. Sales of biologics in 2006 are expected to total $1.5 billion; Pfizer expects to triple revenues from biologics by 2010, placing the company among the top five producers of biologics. ""From a single program in 1996, our presence in biologics has grown to encompass more than 36 programs today, and we have a truly enviable pipeline of new medicines in this important area,"" Dr. LaMattina said.

           Pfizer Committed to Vigorous Global Defense Against
      Patent Infringement, Counterfeiting and Foreign Price Controls



Pfizer Vice Chairman and General Counsel Jeffrey Kindler reviewed the progress the company is making on the policy, legal and legislative fronts to effectively meet challenges in the company's operating environment, including threats to its intellectual property.

Regarding intellectual property, Mr. Kindler said, ""We will continue to aggressively defend our medicines from patent challenges and discourage unwarranted attacks on innovators. Many of these attacks are on our basic patents, and we have a 'zero-tolerance' policy for out-and-out patent infringement."" Mr. Kindler cited Pfizer's recent high-profile victories, most notably its defense of Lipitor in the U.S., U.K. and Spain. ""We have established an excellent track record in these cases that has validated our strategy for defending the patents protecting this critical medicine,"" he said.

Mr. Kindler also said Pfizer is combating the global threat of counterfeiting on multiple fronts, including focusing more resources on anti- counterfeiting investigations and working cooperatively with government and law enforcement agencies around the world to address the problem.

In the policy area, Mr. Kindler noted that Pfizer is addressing foreign price controls and access restrictions as a top priority. ""We are enlisting a broad array of allies, including the U.S. government, to advance policies supporting healthcare innovation around the world. With so much of the research-based pharmaceutical industry located in the U.S., we believe that this will become an even greater priority for keeping America at the forefront of health and economic prosperity.

""As the U.S. Department of Commerce has recognized, not only do foreign price controls and access restrictions harm patients in those countries, they also force American patients to bear a disproportionate share of the cost of research and development for new treatments,"" he said.

Conclusion. In summary, Hank McKinnell said, ""Pfizer is changing, our industry is changing, and healthcare systems around the world are changing. We believe that future healthcare will be rooted in prevention and wellness and early diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases. All of these approaches play to Pfizer's strengths. With our highly talented workforce, Pfizer can be a catalyst in this evolution toward integrated, affordable and patient-centered healthcare.""

262,Pfizer2,"Pfizer Receives FDA Approval for Eraxis(TM) to Treat Candidemia, a Potentially Life-Threatening Bloodstream Infection; People with Weakened Immune Systems and Critically Ill Patients are Among Those at High Risk for Candidemia Infection; Eraxis Builds on Pfizer's Strength in Antifungal Medicines",,959 words,21 February 2006,10:44 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, Feb. 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that Eraxis(TM) (anidulafungin) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat candidemia, a potentially life-threatening bloodstream infection. Candidemia is the most deadly of the common hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, with a mortality rate of approximately 40 percent.

In the United States, candidemia affects approximately one in 5,000 people, resulting in an estimated 60,000 cases each year. ""Bloodstream infections such as candidemia can spread quickly and are very dangerous, especially for patients with weakened immune systems,"" said Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer. ""Physicians treating these seriously ill patients now have an important new treatment in Eraxis.""","Patients at high risk for candidemia and systemic candidiasis (Candida infection that spreads throughout the body) include those with compromised immune systems, stem-cell and organ-transplant recipients, patients on chemotherapy, patients with catheters, critically ill patients in intensive care units, surgical patients and patients on prolonged antibiotic therapy. In the U.S., patients with candidemia on average spend an additional 10 days in the hospital at an average increase in hospital charges of about $39,000 per patient.

""In the clinical trial setting, patients taking Eraxis for the treatment of candidemia had improved efficacy versus those taking fluconazole, making Eraxis an important addition to the options in antifungal treatment,"" said Dr. Annette Reboli, head of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, New Jersey, and lead clinical investigator. ""In addition, Eraxis has been shown to have a safety profile comparable to fluconazole and to be compatible with many medicines commonly used by patients with candidemia who have other serious health complications.""

Eraxis, an antifungal medicine of the echinocandin class, also was approved by the FDA to treat two additional infections caused by the Candida fungus-peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscesses -- as well as esophageal candidiasis, a fungal infection of the esophagus.

Eraxis builds upon Pfizer's extraordinary strength in medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases, particularly antifungal treatments. Pfizer's Diflucan(R) (fluconazole) has been the longstanding gold standard treatment for candidemia and other fungal infections, especially opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients. Pfizer's Vfend(R) (voriconazole), also a product of innovative Pfizer research, is a treatment for serious mold and yeast infections. Both Diflucan and Vfend are azole-type antifungal treatments.

Eraxis is the only medicine that has demonstrated improved efficacy versus fluconazole in a pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of candidemia. Eraxis was added to the company's antifungal portfolio through the acquisition of Vicuron in September 2005.

About Candida Infections

Candidemia is a systemic fungal infection that occurs when Candida organisms are present in the blood. The bloodstream may then spread Candida to organs and tissues throughout the body, causing systemic candidiasis.

Systemic candidiasis is difficult to diagnose and can cause organ failure, which may result in death. It can infect organs such as the kidneys, liver, bones, muscles, joints, spleen, or eyes.

Esophageal candidiasis is a fungal infection of the esophagus that is most common among people with compromised immune systems such as people with HIV/AIDS.

About Eraxis

Eraxis is an antifungal agent indicated for the treatment of candidemia and two other Candida infections, peritonitis (infection of the abdominal cavity) and intra-abdominal abscesses. Eraxis has not been studied in endocarditis, osteomyclitis, and meningitis due to Candida, and has not been studied in sufficient numbers of neutropenic patients (those with low white blood cell counts) to determine efficacy in this group. It was also approved for esophageal candidiasis, an infection of the esophagus caused by Candida (relapse rates post-therapy were higher for patients on Eraxis).

Important Safety Information

In clinical studies, Eraxis was as well tolerated as fluconazole and the total number of drug-related adverse events was comparable to fluconazole. The most common treatment-related adverse events for Eraxis in the candidemia study included lower than normal levels of potassium in the blood (3.1%), diarrhea (3.1%), and an increase in ALT (a liver enzyme) (2.3%). In the esophageal candidiasis study, the most common treatment-related adverse events for Eraxis were headache (1.3%) and an increase of GGT (a liver enzyme) (1.3%).

Eraxis has not been associated with renal toxicity, and has no clinically relevant drug-to-drug interactions. Eraxis also does not require dose adjustments based on gender, race, age, HIV status, hepatic insufficiency or renal insufficiency. (Safety and effectiveness of Eraxis in pediatric patients has not been established.)

Eraxis is not approved for use in patients with hypersensitivity to anidulafungin, any component of Eraxis, or other echinocandin agents. In some patients with serious underlying medical conditions who were receiving multiple concomitant medications along with Eraxis, clinically significant hepatic abnormalities have occurred. Possible histamine-mediated symptoms have been reported infrequently with Eraxis, including rash, urticaria, flushing, pruritis, dyspnea, and hypotension.

280,Pfizer2,Pfizer Completes Acquisition of Worldwide Rights to Exubera From sanofi-aventis; First Inhalable Form of Insulin for the Treatment of Adults with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes,,370 words,1 March 2006,10:23 AM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"NEW YORK, March 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Pfizer Inc said today that it has acquired the sanofi-aventis worldwide rights to Exubera (inhaled human insulin). Pfizer received approval last month to market Exubera in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Exubera is the first inhalable form of insulin to be approved since the discovery of insulin in the 1920s, and represents a major advance in diabetes treatment.","Diabetes is a leading cause of death by disease worldwide and is currently at epidemic proportions. If blood sugar levels are not controlled, serious complications including heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and nerve damage will often develop. Approximately 194 million people worldwide have the disease.

Exubera is a rapid-acting, dry powder human insulin that is inhaled through the mouth into the lungs prior to eating, using a portable, handheld inhaler that when closed is about the size of an eyeglass case. Exubera is the result of one of the most rigorous and innovative diabetes development programs ever conducted.

In clinical trials, many patients using Exubera reported greater treatment satisfaction than patients taking insulin by injection. Even those patients who had used both Exubera and insulin injections or diabetes pills reported an overall preference for Exubera.

Pfizer and sanofi-aventis were previously in a worldwide alliance to co-develop, co-promote and co-manufacture Exubera. Pfizer has also acquired the sanofi-aventis rights to the Exubera insulin production facilities located in Frankfurt, Germany, which were previously jointly owned by Pfizer and sanofi-aventis. Exubera is currently a product of collaboration between Pfizer and Nektar Therapeutics.

290,Pfizer2,"'Only Lipitor Has Demonstrated Significant LDL Reductions and Cardiovascular Benefits for a Wide Range of Patients, With an Excellent Efficacy and Safety Profile Across the Full Dose Range'; Lipitor demonstrated plaque regression in REVERSAL trial",,425 words,13 March 2006,01:00 PM,PR Newswire (U.S.),PRN,,,English,Copyright ?  2006  PR Newswire Association LLC.  All Rights Reserved.,"ATLANTA, March 13 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- In response to inquiries from the news media about the ASTEROID trial for Crestor presented today at the American College of Cardiology, Pfizer issued the following statement:","-- Only Lipitor has demonstrated significant LDL reductions and
     cardiovascular benefits for a wide range of patients, with an excellent
     efficacy and safety profile across the full dose range.

  -- This is not the first time a statin has demonstrated plaque regression.
     The REVERSAL trial compared treatment with Lipitor 80mg to another
     lipid lowering agent over 18 months.  In a subset of high-plaque burden
     patients, Lipitor demonstrated a 5.9% (P<.001) total plaque reduction
     with excellent toleration.

  -- It is not possible to compare the findings from ASTEROID with REVERSAL
     given ASTEROID's open label, single-arm design did not include a
     comparator.  In contrast, Lipitor has demonstrated significant LDL and
     cardiovascular benefits in well controlled clinical trials such as
     PROVE IT, TNT and IDEAL.

  -- Treatment practice has evolved significantly in the past several years,
     strongly supported by the results of the Lipitor clinical outcomes
     trials.  Studies like PROVE IT, TNT and IDEAL have conclusively
     demonstrated the benefit of intensive lipid lowering with Lipitor.

  -- The LDL levels reached in these studies, ranging from 60 to 80 mg/dL,
     are attainable only through intensive lipid lowering to a degree that
     cannot be matched with older, less efficacious therapies such as
     simvastatin.

  -- Lipitor has a proven record of safety and over 115 million patient
     years of experience that cannot be matched by any other medicine.

  -- Pfizer is using the IVUS technology in its large-scale Phase III
     torcetrapib/atorvastatin clinical trials program, which is studying
     some 25,000 patients at hundreds of medical centers worldwide.

  -- The results from these trials, which will report out in the near
     future, will provide additional information on the lipid hypotheses
     alluded to in ASTEROID in a well-controlled manner.

293,Pfizer2,New Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin Research Further Supports Raising 'Good' HDL Cholesterol,,"1,560 words",14 March 2006,09:11 AM,PR Newswire Europe,TWOTEN,,,English,Copyright ? 2006 PR Newswire Europe Limited.  All Rights Reserved.,"ATLANTA, March 14 /PRNewswire/ --


    -- Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin Clinical Trial Program is the Largest Ever
       Conducted by Pfizer: 25,000 Patients Enrolled in Studies Underway
       Around the World
    -- Pfizer Clinician: ""First Data to Show that there are Important
       Differences in Raising HDL Cholesterol Levels with Torcetrapib and
       Atorvastatin Depending on Whether it is Dosed in the Morning or
       Evening""
    -- TNT Trial Investigator: ""The TNT Sub-Analysis Suggests that HDL
       Cholesterol May Also Provide Important Therapeutic Benefits that May
       Result in Further Reductions in Cardiovascular Risk""","Pfizer said today that new data, involving its medicine in development torcetrapib/atorvastatin, provides important information on the benefit of raising HDL, or ""good"" cholesterol, while simultaneously lowering LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. These new findings may play a critical role in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease and potentially improving quality of life for patients. Data from three separate studies were presented this week at the American College of Cardiology meeting.

""As the first potential treatment to offer substantial HDL cholesterol elevations and significant LDL cholesterol lowering, torcetrapib/atorvastatin could well change how physicians manage their patients with cardiovascular disease,"" said Dr. John LaMattina, president of Pfizer Global Research and Development. ""This comprehensive clinical trial program will help determine if this hypothesis can offer patients the benefit of slowing atherosclerosis and ultimately preventing cardiovascular events beyond what can be achieved with Lipitor alone.""

It is estimated that 71 million Americans suffer from cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death in the United States. Most people with elevated cholesterol, a leading risk factor for heart attacks and strokes, are either not diagnosed or have not reached their target LDL levels with medication. In addition, research has shown that raising HDL-cholesterol may provide further benefits in the management of cardiovascular disease, which may have the potential to further reduce cardiovascular risk for patients.

Discovered and developed by Pfizer, torcetrapib works by blocking CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein) which is a protein that regulates cholesterol and is responsible for transferring cholesterol from its ""good"" HDL carrier to LDL, the ""bad"" carrier of cholesterol that results in plaque buildup in the arteries. Scientists believe that CETP inhibition raises HDL levels which results in cholesterol removal from the artery walls. Torcetrapib also lowers LDL cholesterol and LDL is known to cause heart attacks and stroke.

Presentation 1 - HDL and LDL as Predictors for CV Disease/Sub- Analysis of Lipitor TNT Study

The primary objective of the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study was to demonstrate the clinical benefits of intensive LDL cholesterol lowering. This sub-analysis of TNT found that patients treated to LDL cholesterol levels that were below current medical guidelines showed a direct relationship between HDL cholesterol levels and the frequency of cardiovascular events -- 1 mg/dL increase in HDL cholesterol levels was estimated to have an associated 2 percent reduction in the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

""This study further supports the potential benefits of managing HDL levels as an additional target for patients who are already receiving statin therapy,"" said Dr. Philip Barter, lead author, TNT sub-analysis, The Heart Institute in Sydney, Australia. ""While lowering LDL cholesterol remains a critical focus in cardiovascular disease prevention, the TNT sub-analysis suggests that HDL cholesterol may also provide important therapeutic benefits that may result in further reductions in cardiovascular risk.""

Presentation 2 - Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin: AM vs PM: Examining the Optimal Time of Dosing

Patients received either torcetrapib (100 mg) alone or torcetrapib (60 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) together, taken in the mornings or evenings, to determine if greater increases in HDL would be achieved based on the time of dosing. Torcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor is believed to be most effective when taken in the morning. Unlike most statins -- which are taken in the evening for maximum reduction in LDL cholesterol -- atorvastatin can be dosed anytime of the day and obtain equal LDL lowering effects.

Patients who took torcetrapib (60 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) in the morning experienced the most significant increase of 54.4 percent in HDL-cholesterol which was 12 percent higher than patients who took both torcetrapib and atorvastatin in the evening. Additionally, patients achieved a reduction in LDL cholesterol levels regardless of the time of day that therapy was taken.

""This is the first data to show that there are important differences in raising HDL cholesterol levels with torcetrapib depending on whether it is dosed in the morning or evening, and also highlights the flexibility and efficacy of atorvastatin,"" said Dr. Megan Gibbs, associate director of clinical research of Pfizer Global Research and Development.

Presentation 3 - Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin: Exploring Benefits of Lipid-Modifying Effects

Pfizer researchers also presented data from another study involving 493 patients to determine the effectiveness of torcetrapib (30, 60, 90 mg) either alone or in combination with atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, 80 mg).

In particular, the study addressed the HDL and LDL particle size and number using new technology -- nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Leading researchers believe both larger HDL and LDL particles, and lower numbers of LDL particles are less likely to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, or plaque build-up in the arteries, which is important in cardiovascular health. In this study, patients taking torcetrapib and atorvastatin together experienced a decrease in LDL cholesterol, and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels, as well as increases in the particle size of both HDL and LDL.

""These data provide important information on how CETP inhibition with torcetrapib affects the number and nature of lipid particles,"" said Dr. Tom Thuren, director of clinical development, Pfizer Global Research and Development. ""While the impact of these changes on cardiovascular risk is not currently known, we are diligently examining this and other areas in a large-scale clinical trial program.""

In this study, side effects of torcetrapib and Lipitor were similar to those most commonly associated with statin therapy. Patients taking 60 mg of torcetrapib with Lipitor also experienced an increase in systolic blood pressure of approximately 2 mm Hg, which will be further defined in ongoing phase 3 studies.

Pfizer's torcetrapib/atorvastatin development program is the largest and most comprehensive clinical trial program the company has ever undertaken and is studying some 25,000 patients at hundreds of medical centers worldwide at a cost of about US$800 million.

Lipitor Information

Lipitor is the most prescribed cholesterol-lowering therapy in the world, with nearly 107 million patient-years of experience.

It is used, in patients with multiple risk factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low HDL cholesterol or smoking, to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke and, along with a low-fat diet, to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is also used in patients with type 2 diabetes and one other risk factor such as high blood pressure, smoking, or other complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack.

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is not for women who are nursing, pregnant, or may become pregnant.

Patients who take Lipitor should tell their doctor about any unusual muscle pain or weakness. This could be a sign of serious muscle side effects. Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take. This may help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check patients' liver function before and during drug treatment, and may adjust the dose of Lipitor. Its most common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. They tend to be mild and often go away.
